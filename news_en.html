          <p><span class="half_linespace"><a href="download_en.html#Windows"><strong>Safe Exam Browser 2.3 for Windows released</strong></a>. SEB 2.3 for Windows offers new features, which increase security and usability significantly</span>.</p>
          <p><strong>Please note our new update policy: We will only support the latest SEB version and will remove all older SEB versions after a grace period.</strong> Only with updated SEB versions you can achieve the best possible security and stability of e-assessments. <strong>Before asking any support question or reporting a bug, install the latest SEB version and try to reproduce the issue with the most recent version. </strong></p>
          <p>New in SEB 2.3:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Implemented private clipboard (optional, see Security tab). When enabled, cut/copy/paste works only with content inside the SEB browser, the private clipboard doesn't accept content from other applications or tools.</li>
            <li>Added zooming of browser windows using the Ctrl +/- shortcuts.</li>
            <li>Now downloads can be enabled/disabled with the option &quot;Allow downloading and uploading files&quot;.</li>
            <li>Enabled SpeechSynthesis API.</li>
            <li> Fixed issue when opening a PDF with a link to be opened in a new browser window (target = _blank or JavaScript open), a second, empty browser window was opened.</li>
            <li> Deactivated printing in the built-in PDF.js viewer, as that opened a security hole.</li>
            <li>Now it's possible to open an embedded PDF file (embedded Additional Resource) when starting a SEB session, instead of a Start URL.</li>
            <li>mailto: links are now being ignored.</li>
            <li>Fixed security issue with quitting SEB when Firefox was running.</li>
            <li>More eligible SSL/TLS certificates are displayed in the list &quot;Choose TLS/SSL certificate to embed into configuration...&quot; and the one for CA certificates in SEB Config Tool / Network / Certificates.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><span class="half_linespace">See <a href="windows/win_release_notes_en.html">release notes</a></span> for all changes.</p>
			
          <h5 id="sebh5">August 27, 2019</h5>
          
          <p><span class="half_linespace"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/safeexambrowser/id1155002964?mt=8" target="_blank"><strong>Safe Exam Browser 2.1.14 for iOS released</strong></a>. </span>Despite the minor change in version number (which is due to harmonizing SEB features and version numbers throughout the supported platforms), this release includes major improvements. These allow to run web-based exams on iOS devices with the best security possible. SEB 2.1.14 for iOS offers  almost all features of the desktop versions of Safe Exam Browser and should be fully compatible to exam and learning management systems with built-in SEB support. Some new features and improvements are currently only available in the iOS version, but will be added to future releases of the Mac and Windows versions of SEB.</p>
          <p><span class="half_linespace">SEB 2.1.14</span> adds these important SEB features:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> The <strong>Browser Exam Key</strong> and the new <strong>Config Key</strong> hash values are generated by SEB for iOS and sent with HTTP requests. Compatible assessment systems can use these  values to verify that an exam is accessed with an approved version of SEB and deny access  if a regular browser is used, if SEB is used with wrong settings or if a manipulated version of SEB is used.</li>
            <li> SEB for iOS now supports the <strong>URL filter feature</strong> to restrict access to websites/pages/web resources. Use the desktop versions of SEB to generate config files containing such URL filter rules.</li>
            <li> SEB now uses the full native resolution when running on   iPad Pro devices with Face ID.</li>
            <li>SEB now supports Slide Over and Split View when not running in Single App Mode (for open book exams or when using SEB together with other apps in exams on managed devices).</li>
            <li> On iPad devices supporting picture in picture video (PiP),  video plays in a movable and resizable overlay window. If not running SEB in Single App Mode (open book exams, using other apps in exams on managed devices), PiP video keeps playing even if switching to other apps.</li>
            <li>Added options to allow media auto play and to control if video can be played inline on a web page or only in full screen.            </li>
            <li>SEB for iOS now optionally supports downloading website generated files (using the data: scheme) . This feature allows saving encrypted exam results in case network connection fails. Such downloaded files can be accessed in the Files app ("On My iPad/iPhone" location) and with iTunes.</li>
            <li>Added support for encrypting SEB config files with identity certificates. These certificates have to be distributed to exam devices by embedding them into a <strong>client config</strong> file.  SEB <strong>exam config</strong> files  encrypted with this certificate can afterwards be opened  without students having to enter an SEB exam settings password.<br>
            </li>
            <li>New identity certificates for encrypting and decrypting config files can easily be created in the built-in settings editor. They can even be automatically  created and auto-selected  for encrypting exam configs.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Added options for links requesting to open in new tab: open in same or new tab, always block or block when on another server.<br>
            </li>
            <li>The Quit Link feature can now optionally restart an exam session instead of quitting it.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Exam sessions can now optionally be reconfigured before having to first quit the running exam session.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Clearing of session cookies can now optionally be disabled, allowing users to stay logged in if they already were in a previous session.<br>
            </li>

It is  already the  product of choice for many educational organizations around the world, enabling millions of fair and safe exams. The SEB Consortium is the body which sustains ongoing funding of the Safe Exam Browser open source project to continue its  development, maintenance and support activities.</p>
          <p class="half_linespace"> ETH Zurich and the SWITCH foundation launched the SEB Consortium in 2016, which currently consists of 16 members from all over Europe.

This v</span>ersion adds important SEB features which were missing in the iOS version until now. If you are using SEB for iOS in your institution or distribute it with your own assessment solution, please contribute to the improvement of the SEB open source software by testing the new SEB 2.1.13 features mentioned below and their compatibility with the desktop versions of Safe Exam Browser.          </p>
          <p><strong>Testing the compatibility of especially this beta version with all exam systems  is crucial</strong>, because it uses some custom networking and web request handling code. </p>
          <p>As the SEB  app is updated automatically on student's iOS devices as soon as a new version is available in the App Store,<strong> it's important that SEB  users test the beta version and report issues BEFORE the final version is released</strong>. So if you are using SEB for iOS in your institution or distribute it with your own assessment solution, <strong>participating in its beta testing helps you to avoid possible issues when the new version is released publicly</strong>.</p>
          <ul>
            <li> The <strong>Browser Exam Key</strong> and the new <strong>Config Key</strong> hash values are generated by SEB for iOS and send with HTTP requests (if enabled in Settings/Exam Session). Compatible assessment systems can use these hash values to verify that an exam is accessed with an approved version of SEB and deny access to the exam if a regular browser is used, if SEB is used with wrong settings or if a manipulated version of SEB is used.</li>
            <li> SEB for iOS now supports the <strong>URL filter feature</strong> to restrict access to websites/pages/web resources. Use the desktop versions of SEB to generate config files containing such URL filter rules.</li>
            <li> SEB 2.1.13 uses the full native resolution when running on the new iPad Pro devices with Face ID.</li>
            <li>SEB for iOS now saves log files, which can help when analyzing issues. Those logs can be emailed   to the SEB developers or to an exam administrator. </li>
            <li>Improved reliability of MDM Managed Configuration, important for iPads owned, deployed and managed by an institution.</li>

Those resources can  either be located on external servers or embedded into SEB configuration files. In the first case, the  <a href="windows/win_usermanual_en.html#NetworkPaneFilterSection">improved URL filter</a> with its simple filter rules effectively allows access to specific content and blocks all other.

URL filter rules created and saved with SEB for macOS are already compatible with SEB 2.2 for Windows. </p>

This SEB version re-introduces the "Create new desktop" kiosk mode, which reliably blocks notifications from various applications like some web browsers. This became possible because the mouse pointer offset problem which occurred with SEB 2.1.5, "Create new desktop" and a recent Windows Creators Update was  solved now.</p>
          <p><strong><a href="download_en.html#Windows">We recommend an immediate update if you're using SEB 2.1.6/2.1.7</a></strong>. If you manually changed your settings to use the "Disable Explorer Shell" kiosk mode with these two SEB versions, then you can change it back to "Create new Desktop" again. You can also remove the default prohibited browser processes from your settings which were added by SEB 2.1.7. </p>
          <p>In addition, SEB 2.1.8 blocks new default prohibited processes like some screen sharing and communication tools, fixes the severe "Sticky Keys" security issue and a rare bug which made it possible to switch applications using the shortcut Win + Tab on some devices. <strong>Note: In this final release version the SEB client has the version 2.1.8.1</strong>. If you installed an earlier build of 2.1.8, then update to this final version now.</p>

This SEB version fixes a problem with Chrome and some other web browsers which could display notifications while SEB was running. This security issue   was induced by SEB 2.1.6 for many SEB users. <strong><a href="download_en.html#Windows">We recommend an immediate update</a></strong> if you're using SEB 2.1.6 or you configured SEB to use the &quot;Disable Explorer Shell&quot; kiosk mode. If you cannot update right now, make sure that Chrome and Chromium-based browsers (for example Vivaldi) and also Firefox are quit before starting SEB. If you're starting exams with SEB links from other browsers, use Edge, Internet Explorer or Opera for this. On managed computers, reboot your computers and start SEB directly, before students take a seat at the exam client (in BYOD scenarios this might not be easy to achieve, so <a href="download_en.html#Windows">updating to SEB 2.1.7</a> is the best fix for this issue).</p>

SEB for iOS opens a web browser without an address and search bar, loads a pre-configured webpage and locks an iPad (or iPhone or iPod Touch) into a single app kiosk mode. This  kiosk mode is built into the iOS operating system and therefore provides a high level of security. Students cannot switch to other apps, access other websites  or communicate with other students during an exam. Notifications,   FaceTime/voice calls and screen shots are also blocked. SEB for iOS works both on unmanaged iOS devices like students' own iPads as well as on iOS devices owned and managed by an institution. </p>
          <p class="half_linespace">SEB for iOS is compatible with the existing versions for macOS and Windows. You can use the same SEB config links and files to start exams in SEB from Safari or Mail or to configure SEB to display your institution's exam system start/portal page. This first version contains some new features currently unique to the iOS version and some features of the macOS/Windows versions are not yet available.

The fact that SEB only connects to the exam server that you configured is actually one major advantage of SEB compared to commercial secure exam solutions.

          <p class="half_linespace"><a href="download_en.html#MacOSX">Safe Exam Browser 2.1.2 for macOS</a> fixes some issues of the recent release SEB 2.1.1 which could occur in non-default screen configurations and when starting SEB by opening specific settings. It also contains a usability improvement: When starting SEB by opening a .seb config file or a seb(s):// link, the start URL from persistent  settings of the SEB client isn't opened first anymore, instead the new settings are directly applied. In case loading or decrypting  these  settings isn’t successful (load error, canceled by the user, wrong decryption credentials etc.), SEB  quits instead of continuing with the persistent client settings.</p>

          <ul id="seblist">
            <li>Fully compatible with macOS 10.12 Sierra</li>
            <li>Implements support for embedded TLS/SSL &amp; CA certificates and certificate pinning  for enhanced security when connecting with exam servers.</li>
            <li>SEB is now using a private clipboard, so utilities running in the background and Universal Clipboard (on macOS 10.12 Sierra) cannot be used to copy-paste contents into or out of exams.</li>
            <li> WebAudio API is enabled now.</li>
            <li> Added blocking panels and windows opened by third party tools running in the background.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Added detection for macOS ScreenSharing.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Added deactivating display mirroring and a new setting option for a maximum number of displays which the user is allowed to use. This can prevent wireless displays to be used to cheat or leak exam content.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Added full support for Basic/Digest and NTLM Authentication.</li>
            <li>Loading seb(s):// linked settings from authenticated servers is possible now, even with indirect links (not containing the config file name with the .seb extension, like for example sebs://example.com/download.php?id=2352). Therefore a SEB exam config file can be stored for example into the same Moodle course as the quiz. The login session is remembered,  students don't have to login twice in SEB if you start SEB/an exam using a seb(s):// link to a config file on an authenticated server.</li>
            <li>Added a new settings option to enforce SEB being used with a specific minimal macOS version. </li>
            <li>On a trackpad supporting Force Touch, the lookup feature (invoked by strongly pressing the trackpad while the cursor is over a word or text selection) is  also blocked now.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Fixed various minor issues.          </li>

            <li>Current versions of Internet Explorer, Edge and Windows 10 complained about an invalid signature of the SEB 2.1.2 installer when downloading or starting it, as Microsoft doesn't accept insecure SHA1 code signatures anymore. SEB 2.1.3 is signed with a new code signing certificate with a secure SHA-256 signature.</li>
            <li> Added support for system proxy settings (the existing option in SEB Config Tool / Network / Proxies is functional now).</li>

Deployment of online examinations at traditional educational institutions and beyond has been increasing steadily, together with the recent rise of massive open online courses (MOOCs). The Safe Exam Browser (SEB) is a secure and reliable lockdown browser, which is already the open source product of choice for many educational organisations in this context. SEB is known for versatility, its software quality and its engagement with the user, standards and development communities.</p>
          <p class="half_linespace">However, SEB requires ongoing funding for its maintenance, development and support activities. For this reason ETH Zurich and the SWITCH foundation have decided to launch the SEB Consortium. The Consortium invites further bodies, which may range from educational institutions to companies and public authorities, to join and work together on the promising future of this impressive open-source tool: <a href="http://safeexambrowser.org/consortium">www.safeexambrowser.org/consortium</a>.</p>

          <p class="half_linespace"><a href="download_en.html#Windows">SEB Windows 1.8.1</a> fixes two bugs:</p>
          <ul id="seblist">
            <li>Clicking on the SEB icon of the user's desktop in some cases launched the SEB installer rather than the actual SEB application. Now the SEB installer creates a shortcut to the SEB application on the <strong>common</strong> desktop. Thus the SEB icon and shortcut are visible to <strong>all</strong> users, and clicking on this icon launches the SEB application as intended.</li>
            <li>When finishing, SEB restored the <strong>default</strong> registry values for Task Manager etc. (on the blue <em>Windows Security Screen</em>). Now, SEB instead restores the <strong>previous</strong> registry values (= the values before SEB was started).</li>

New security features include clearing the clipboard,  blocking browsing forward/backward, preventing possible security holes in Flash content, offering fine grade settings for opening and blocking links in new browser windows and in addition the upload of files edited in third party applications was made easier and more secure.</p>

          <p><a href="download_en.html#Windows">SEB Windows 1.8</a> easens the configuration for the teacher. It is now possible     to do the configuration in a new GUI editor called <em>SebWindowsConfig.exe</em> using mouse clicks, without directly editing the initialisation files <em>SebStarter.ini</em> and <em>MsgHook.ini</em>. The file format of these ini files has been simplified and is now better human-readable. In addition to the full version of SEB (installation via .msi file), a classic portable version can be built (copying of a zip file without installation), which has less functionality.</p>
