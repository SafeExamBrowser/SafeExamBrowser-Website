            <ul id="seblist">
              <li>Added new setting in Browser  pane to reload the full page after a connection error (instead of loading the failed URL. This is a workaround for some LMS/assessment system issues e.g. in Moodle.<br>
</li>
              <li>Fixed that disabling spell check and auto correct sometimes didn't work in WKWebView: Disabled it completely (can't be configured anymore for macOS/iOS).</li>
              <li>Changed WebKit Networking process blocking to not lock SEB when a WebKit networking process is running with elevated user priority.</li>
              <li>Fixed: Permissions for microphone-only access didn't work.</li>
              <li>Fixed: Text Replacements can be used in SEB.</li>
              <li>Prevent Keyboard Viewer to be used, which still shows Text Replacements.</li>
              <li>Now detecting and denying to run when custom Cocoa Text System key bindings are set.</li>
              <li>Fixed: Chrome video conferencing was no longer stopped when using current Chrome versions.</li>
              <li>Fixed: Settings menubar menu and cmd - S were available during exam in some cases.</li>
              <li>Now clarifying in locked exam lock screen that the <strong>quit password of the current session</strong> needs to be entered to unlock SEB.</li>
              <li>Fixed an Xcode build error which caused SEB 3.3.2 to not run on macOS 10.13.</li>

          <ul id="seblist">
            <li>Removed the Autofill Contacts/Passwords context menu item in text fields on iOS 17.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Fixed wrong browser toolbar height in iPhone landscape mode on iOS 17 and after rotating an iPad with iPadOS 17.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Fixed Search text icon had a text field background color on iOS 16/17.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Display deprecation warning when classic WebView is used.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Added setting in Browser Features pane to disable deprecation warning when classic WebView is used.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Now using an alternative method to add the SEB User Agent string in HTTP Headers with classic WebView. This avoids compatibility issues when an assessment system with SEB integration doesn't yet support the modern WebView (doesn't use the SEB Javascript API to query ConfigKey/BrowserExamKey). <br>
              <strong>This fix nevertheless is no reason to delay implementing support for the modern WebView in SEB integrations. Any iOS update may break support for the classic WebView (UIWebView) finally!</strong><br>
            </li>
            <li>Added new setting in Browser Features pane to reload the full page after a connection error (instead of loading the failed URL. This is a workaround for some LMS/assessment system issues e.g. in Moodle.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Fixed: When using the optional SEB Server, locking the client didn't work.<br>

          <p><strong>IMPORTANT for SEB Integrations: The classic WebView</strong> (the iOS framework UIWebView) <strong>has been</strong> <strong>DEPRECATED by Apple </strong>years ago, it's no longer maintained and will at some point be removed completely from iOS/iPadOS.<strong> It's crucial that assessment systems with SEB Integrations, which are using the Browser Exam Key (BEK) and Config Key (CK), transition to the <a href="developer/seb-config-key.html">SEB Javascript API</a></strong> to query these keys, as the modern WebView (iOS/macOS framework WKWebView) doesn't support transmitting the BEK/CK in HTTP request headers. <a href="developer/seb-config-key.html">See our documentation</a> about how to adopt the SEB JS API. <strong> SEB now displays a warning message if the classic WebView is used by your SEB settings, as it's now of upmost importance to move away from the classic WebView and only use the modern one. </strong></p>

		  <p><strong>Apple fixed iOS issue, which caused crashes with iOS 17:</strong> According to Apple's feedback and our testing, the issue causing SEB to crash when  any text input field was being displayed or activated (taking input focus) was fixed in iOS 17.1. Therefore the easiest solution to fix these issues is to update to the current iOS version.</p>
		  <p dir="auto">In the meantime we found the likely reason why it these crashes happened only on some devices and not on others: If Guided Access was enabled (<em>iOS Settings / Accessibility / Guided Access</em>), then these crashes happened in SEB with iOS 17 on our test devices (even though Guided Access itself was not being used with SEB). In one instance we observed similar crashes happening even with iOS 16.7. If you cannot update to iOS 17.1 or newer and observe seemingly random crashes with SEB, try to disable Guided Access.<br>

            <li>Due to refactored code using newer APIs, SEB 3.0 requires macOS 10.11 or later (using the modern WebView requires macOS 10.13 or later). We recommend to only use macOS versions which still receive security updates from Apple (the three most recent, currently macOS 10.14, 10.15 and 11).
            </li>
            <li>Support for the new <a href="developer/seb-config-key.html" rel="nofollow">SEB JavaScript API</a> for easier integration into exam solutions (currently for querying app version details, ConfigKey and BrowserExamKey security elements).
            </li>
            <li>Support for restart session <em>(</em><a href="macosx/mac_usermanual_en.html#link-to-quit-seb-after-exam" rel="nofollow"><em>Preferences/Exam/Link to quit SEB after exam/Restart instead of quitting</em></a><em>)</em> and quit SEB/session features, which are mostly interesting for managed Macs and kiosk environments: If client settings are secure (have a quit password set), SEB was not started with a seb(s) link or .seb file and an exam session is quit, SEB is not quit (terminated), but only the exam session (SEB is restarted with client settings).
            </li>
            <li>Added setting in <em><a href="macosx/mac_usermanual_en.html#SecurityPane">Preferences / Security</a> / Check full macOS version number</em> for full control about minimal allowed macOS version (major/minor/patch version numbers).
            </li>
            <li>Use AAC kiosk mode only on macOS 15.4+ and 11.4+ (except 11.0 - 11.3, as there was an issue with DNS lookup. This caused pages with yet unknown domains to not load). The AAC Assessment Mode is more secure, as it blocks any other applications on the Mac to access the Internet/network and to capture the screen. You can activate it in <a href="macosx/mac_usermanual_en.html#SecurityPane"><em>Preferences / Security</em></a><em> / Use Assessment Mode (AAC) if available</em>.

SEB 2.3 also adds new capabilities, improves the user interface for students and exam administrators and fixes several issues:</p>
          <ul id="seblist6">
            <li>Support for Automatic Assessment Configuration (AAC) macOS Assessment Mode. AAC is used by default if running on macOS 10.15.4 or newer. Assessment Mode blocks various macOS features which shouldn't be accessible during exams. Also no other applications and processes running in the background can access the network while Assessment Mode is active. </li>
            <li>Optionally, the old SEB kiosk mode can be used also on latest macOS versions, as AAC doesn't support optionally enabling features like like screen capture/sharing, Siri and Dictation. Assessment Mode also cannot be used if you want to run a video conferencing solution in the background during an exam for proctoring.</li>
            <li>New options to enforce using the internal (built-in) display of a MacBook or iMac but optionally still allowing to use the external display on a Mac without built-in display (Mac Mini, Mac Pro).</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue when calculating the Config Key for configuration files containing prohibited processes entries for both macOS and Windows.</li>

          <p>We created the  video  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GEn_NWnZe8" target="_blank">Remote Exams With Safe Exam Browser</a>, which is available on the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc_DK52R-5oAOMjFbPsKznw" target="_blank">SafeExamBrowser YouTube Channel</a>. <span dir="auto">It demonstrates the new, optional built-in remote proctoring features in Safe Exam Browser and SEB Server. </span>Our goal is to replicate the situation in an exam hall, where proctors/invigilators walk around and  observe students taking a test. The new live proctoring features allow to monitor exam candidates during the exam using the webcam and microphone in their devices. Proctors or an educator/teacher can also communicate by live video/audio stream or the built-in chat with exam candidates. They can for example give last-minute instructions before the exam starts. Or they can help single students in case of problems during the exam. Future versions will also support live viewing and recording the display of exam devices. </p>
          <p>AI proctoring features allow to optionally track face movements and the number of faces visible in the camera stream. Face detection and tracking is performed on-device, not in any cloud service. Detected events are logged, displayed with a symbol in the video stream and send to a SEB Server instance if connected to one.</p>
          <p>The new remote proctoring features are implemented by integrating the open source video conferencing solution <a href="https://jitsi.org" target="_blank">Jitsi Meet</a> into SEB clients and SEB Server. It is quite easy to set-up an own Jitsi Meet server. As SEB also doesn’t use any centralized cloud services, you have full control of privacy with this solution.</p>
          <p><span dir="auto">Currently these features are available in beta versions of SEB for iOS and developer versions of <a href="https://github.com/SafeExamBrowser/seb-server">SEB Server</a>. Remote proctoring with SEB is still in development, we will communicate availability in SEB versions for macOS and Windows at a later moment.

		  <p><strong><a href="download_en.html#Windows">Safe Exam Browser 3.0.1 for Windows released</a></strong>: This update contains a fix for the issues some users of SEB 3.0.0 observed specifically in BYOD environments. The new version should prevent that anti-malware software falsely identifies SEB 3.0 as malware (false-positive detection using heuristics and similar algorithms).</p>
		  <p>SEB 3.0.1 does no longer access the Windows Registry by default. This means that power options (shutdown, reboot) are no longer disabled and the options is the Windows Security Screen (accessed by Ctrl+Alt+Del) are not removed. </p>
		  <p>SEB still prevents the TaskManager to be used. If you prefer the current behavior, you can disable the new setting "Ignore SEB Service" (setting key sebServiceIgnore = false). If you are using the SEB Windows Service, some of your students might again have to disable or uninstall anti-malware tools to run SEB, unless that software correctly recognizes SEB and doesn’t block it. We requested vendors of reported anti-malware applications to correct the false-positive detection of SEB 3.0 and so far got a positive answer from Avast and Bitdefender. Please inform us if you about other anti-malware products which block SEB (product name and version).</p>

		  <h5 id="sebh5">June 11, 2020</h5>
          <p>A small number of the around 130'000 users which already downloaded  Safe Exam Browser 3.0 encountered issues when  starting it. We investigated these issues and it seems that in all cases anti-malware software caused these. Some of these security software tools falsely identified SEB 3.0 as malware (false-positive detection using heuristics and similar algorithms). This most likely has to do with the improved security features in SEB 3.0, like constant monitoring of the Windows Registry settings which SEB changes during an exam. The affected anti-malware tools block parts of SEB, like the SEB Windows Service. Then SEB either can't start or cannot restore some of the Registry settings (the latter might only happen when Windows tried to run the system update process at the same time SEB was started).</p>
          <p>We are working on solving these issues and also requested  vendors of  reported anti-malware applications to correct the false-positive detection of SEB 3.0.<strong> To prevent such issues, we recommend  using <a href="download_en.html#Windows">SEB 2.4</a> for the moment. </strong></p>

As communicated before, we don't support older versions anymore.</span> <strong>Before asking any support question or reporting a bug, please install the latest SEB version and try to reproduce the issue with the most recent version.</strong></p>
          <ul id="seblist3">
            <li>SEB 2.1.4 is fully compatible with macOS 10.15 Catalina.</li>
            <li>The SEB application is now notarized and uses the Hardened Runtime security feature.</li>
            <li>Implemented key shortcuts for switching between open browser windows.<br>
Left Alt (Option) Key - Tab: Cycle forward through open browser windows<br>
Left Alt (Option) Key - Left Shift Key - Tab: Cycle backwards through open browser windows<br>
            </li>
            <li> The default minimum required macOS version was set to 10.11 El Capitan. This means, if you want students to be able to use older macOS versions, you need to adjust that setting if you didn’t had it set in your config already.  </li>
            <li>SEB 2.1.4 uses the final implementation of the Config Key, to verify that an exam is using a correct, unmodified SEB configuration. The Config Key can be generated automatically by a compatible exam system together with the SEB config to be used for an exam. All SEB versions supporting the Config Key generate the same key, as long as the same SEB config file is used. Currently SEB for iOS supports the Config Key as well, a compatible Windows version will follow later this year.</li>
            <li>Custom App Controls and Quick Actions in Touch Bar, also with enabled Control Strip,  are now disabled, even if BetterTouchTool is used. </li>
            <li>Implemented blocking macOS screen recording (Cmd+Shift+5) introduced in Mojave, controlled with setting Preferences / Security / Allow screen capture.</li>
            <li>Selecting multiple files for upload is now possible, controlled by the HTML input element (multiple-attribute).</li>
            <li>Fixed: Media player app (iTunes etc.) can block SEB, when set to full screen and started using the Play key. The previous implementation didn't work properly on Mojave and newer.</li>
            <li>Fixed downloads not working and an issue with the default location for the Downloads directory on macOS 10.14 Mojave or newer.</li>
            <li>Fixed downloading and opening of SEB config files defined inline on a webpage with &quot;data:&quot; URL didn't work.</li>
            <li>Fixed: JavaScript confirm dialog didn't return false when cancel (or any secondary) button was clicked.</li>
            <li>Red lock screen for &quot;SEB process was stopped&quot; is no longer displayed when Mac is set to sleep mode. </li>
            <li>Improved preventing a modal lock (SEB freezes) when a webpage tries to download a font (displaying a dialog hidden by SEB's kiosk mode). When SEB doesn't have the needed Accessibility permissions to close the dialog, it is now terminated  after saving information on which webpage the font download was attempted (title and URL or placeholder). This is then displayed when SEB is started next time.          </li>

These allow to run web-based exams on iOS devices with the best security possible. SEB 2.1.14 for iOS offers  almost all features of the desktop versions of Safe Exam Browser and should be fully compatible to exam and learning management systems with built-in SEB support. Some new features and improvements are currently only available in the iOS version, but will be added to future releases of the Mac and Windows versions of SEB.</p>
          <p><span class="half_linespace">SEB 2.1.14</span> adds these important SEB features:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> The <strong>Browser Exam Key</strong> and the new <strong>Config Key</strong> hash values are generated by SEB for iOS and sent with HTTP requests. Compatible assessment systems can use these  values to verify that an exam is accessed with an approved version of SEB and deny access  if a regular browser is used, if SEB is used with wrong settings or if a manipulated version of SEB is used.</li>
            <li> SEB for iOS now supports the <strong>URL filter feature</strong> to restrict access to websites/pages/web resources. Use the desktop versions of SEB to generate config files containing such URL filter rules.</li>
            <li> SEB now uses the full native resolution when running on   iPad Pro devices with Face ID.</li>
            <li>SEB now supports Slide Over and Split View when not running in Single App Mode (for open book exams or when using SEB together with other apps in exams on managed devices).</li>
            <li> On iPad devices supporting picture in picture video (PiP),  video plays in a movable and resizable overlay window. If not running SEB in Single App Mode (open book exams, using other apps in exams on managed devices), PiP video keeps playing even if switching to other apps.</li>
            <li>Added options to allow media auto play and to control if video can be played inline on a web page or only in full screen.            </li>
            <li>SEB for iOS now optionally supports downloading website generated files (using the data: scheme) . This feature allows saving encrypted exam results in case network connection fails. Such downloaded files can be accessed in the Files app ("On My iPad/iPhone" location) and with iTunes.</li>
            <li>Added support for encrypting SEB config files with identity certificates. These certificates have to be distributed to exam devices by embedding them into a <strong>client config</strong> file.  SEB <strong>exam config</strong> files  encrypted with this certificate can afterwards be opened  without students having to enter an SEB exam settings password.<br>
            </li>
            <li>New identity certificates for encrypting and decrypting config files can easily be created in the built-in settings editor. They can even be automatically  created and auto-selected  for encrypting exam configs.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Added options for links requesting to open in new tab: open in same or new tab, always block or block when on another server.<br>
            </li>
            <li>The Quit Link feature can now optionally restart an exam session instead of quitting it.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Exam sessions can now optionally be reconfigured before having to first quit the running exam session.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Clearing of session cookies can now optionally be disabled, allowing users to stay logged in if they already were in a previous session.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Deep linking for exams now also works with sebs:// links (in addition to Universal Links).<br>
            </li>

            <li>SEB for iOS now saves log files, which can help when analyzing issues. Those logs can be emailed   to the SEB developers or to an exam administrator. </li>
            <li>Improved reliability of MDM Managed Configuration, important for iPads owned, deployed and managed by an institution.</li>
            <li>Added iOS 13 to the "Allow Running on iOS Beta" option.</li>
            <li>SEB 2.1.14 fixes an issue in SEB 2.1.13 which occurred when checking app integrity. </li>

            <li> SEB 2.1.13 uses the full native resolution when running on the new iPad Pro devices with Face ID.</li>
            <li>SEB for iOS now saves log files, which can help when analyzing issues. Those logs can be emailed   to the SEB developers or to an exam administrator. </li>
            <li>Improved reliability of MDM Managed Configuration, important for iPads owned, deployed and managed by an institution.</li>

SEB 2.2.2 is a maintenance update for SEB 2.2 and contains  two bug fixes for SEB 2.2.1. If you're using the Browser Exam Key (request header check) to verify if the correct SEB configuration and SEB version is used, you should definitely update to SEB 2.2.2.</span></p>
          <ul>
            <li> Fixed an issue in calculating the Browser Exam Key in the SEB Config Tool, which happened with specific config files.</li>
            <li> Added a check for detecting additional files in SEB's program directory (which might have been left there when updating from an older SEB version) and displaying a warning in that case. Such left over files cause a wrong Browser Exam Key as well.</li>
            <li> Fixed an issue when en-US was always selected as spell checking language, even if not allowed in settings, when starting SEB first time or after the contents of the Firefox Profiles folder were removed.          </li>

          <p><a href="download_en.html#Windows"><strong>Safe Exam Browser 2.2 for Windows released</strong></a>. SEB 2.2 for Windows is a major update with new features and many improvements. Using the powerful new feature <a href="windows/win_usermanual_en.html#AdditionalResources">Additional Resources</a>, specific webpages, full or partial websites, HTML5 web applications and documents can  be accessed securely and easily  in exams. Those resources can  either be located on external servers or embedded into SEB configuration files. In the first case, the  <a href="windows/win_usermanual_en.html#NetworkPaneFilterSection">improved URL filter</a> with its simple filter rules effectively allows access to specific content and blocks all other. In the second case,  resources  embedded in SEB configuration files allow fully offline exam scenarios. See the <a href="windows/win_usermanual_en.html">SEB 2.2 manual</a> and <a href="windows/win_release_notes_en.html">release notes</a> for all changes.</p>
          <p>This version is replacing the SEB 2.1.x branch, with which it is <strong>compatible with one important exception</strong>: If you defined URL filter rules in SEB 2.1.x for Windows, then you'll have to re-enter those in the 2.2 SEB Config Tool, following the new filter rule scheme. URL filter rules created and saved with SEB for macOS are already compatible with SEB 2.2 for Windows. </p>

          <p><a href="download_en.html#Windows"><strong>Important update Safe Exam Browser 2.1.8 for Windows released</strong></a>, which increases security and stability. This SEB version re-introduces the "Create new desktop" kiosk mode, which reliably blocks notifications from various applications like some web browsers. This became possible because the mouse pointer offset problem which occurred with SEB 2.1.5, "Create new desktop" and a recent Windows Creators Update was  solved now.</p>
          <p><strong><a href="download_en.html#Windows">We recommend an immediate update if you're using SEB 2.1.6/2.1.7</a></strong>. If you manually changed your settings to use the "Disable Explorer Shell" kiosk mode with these two SEB versions, then you can change it back to "Create new Desktop" again. You can also remove the default prohibited browser processes from your settings which were added by SEB 2.1.7. </p>
          <p>In addition, SEB 2.1.8 blocks new default prohibited processes like some screen sharing and communication tools, fixes the severe "Sticky Keys" security issue and a rare bug which made it possible to switch applications using the shortcut Win + Tab on some devices. <strong>Note: In this final release version the SEB client has the version 2.1.8.1</strong>. If you installed an earlier build of 2.1.8, then update to this final version now.</p>

This SEB version fixes a problem with Chrome and some other web browsers which could display notifications while SEB was running. This security issue   was induced by SEB 2.1.6 for many SEB users. <strong><a href="download_en.html#Windows">We recommend an immediate update</a></strong> if you're using SEB 2.1.6 or you configured SEB to use the &quot;Disable Explorer Shell&quot; kiosk mode. If you cannot update right now, make sure that Chrome and Chromium-based browsers (for example Vivaldi) and also Firefox are quit before starting SEB. If you're starting exams with SEB links from other browsers, use Edge, Internet Explorer or Opera for this. On managed computers, reboot your computers and start SEB directly, before students take a seat at the exam client (in BYOD scenarios this might not be easy to achieve, so <a href="download_en.html#Windows">updating to SEB 2.1.7</a> is the best fix for this issue).</p>
          <p class="half_linespace"> In addition, SEB 2.1.7 improves handling permitted and prohibited processes in general and  blocks prohibited processes  more securely.</p>

SEB for iOS opens a web browser without an address and search bar, loads a pre-configured webpage and locks an iPad (or iPhone or iPod Touch) into a single app kiosk mode. This  kiosk mode is built into the iOS operating system and therefore provides a high level of security. Students cannot switch to other apps, access other websites  or communicate with other students during an exam. Notifications,   FaceTime/voice calls and screen shots are also blocked. SEB for iOS works both on unmanaged iOS devices like students' own iPads as well as on iOS devices owned and managed by an institution. </p>
          <p class="half_linespace">SEB for iOS is compatible with the existing versions for macOS and Windows. You can use the same SEB config links and files to start exams in SEB from Safari or Mail or to configure SEB to display your institution's exam system start/portal page. This first version contains some new features currently unique to the iOS version and some features of the macOS/Windows versions are not yet available.

In addition, we  published a first version of a <a href="ios/ios_tutorial_en.html">tutorial</a> which will help exam administrators to better understand how to configure and use SEB for iOS. It also includes how SEB for iOS <a href="ios/ios_tutorial_en.html#UsingWithClassroom">can be used together with the Apple Classroom app</a>. More topics will be added to this tutorial over time.</p>

          <p class="half_linespace">Although SafeExamBrowser and its source code is freely available without requiring any registration with personal details, we received a few requests for a <a href="about_overview_en.html#privacy-statement">privacy statement</a> for the SEB application. The fact that SEB only connects to the exam server that you configured is actually one major advantage of SEB compared to commercial secure exam solutions. Using SEB is probably the best practice for data privacy available in the market, especially for organizations where privacy regulations are strict and exam candidates' data needs to stay inside the organization.</p>

Therefore a SEB exam config file can be stored for example into the same Moodle course as the quiz. The login session is remembered,  students don't have to login twice in SEB if you start SEB/an exam using a seb(s):// link to a config file on an authenticated server.</li>
            <li>Added a new settings option to enforce SEB being used with a specific minimal macOS version. </li>

Deployment of online examinations at traditional educational institutions and beyond has been increasing steadily, together with the recent rise of massive open online courses (MOOCs). The Safe Exam Browser (SEB) is a secure and reliable lockdown browser, which is already the open source product of choice for many educational organisations in this context. SEB is known for versatility, its software quality and its engagement with the user, standards and development communities.</p>
          <p class="half_linespace">However, SEB requires ongoing funding for its maintenance, development and support activities. For this reason ETH Zurich and the SWITCH foundation have decided to launch the SEB Consortium.

          <p><a href="download_en.html#Windows">SEB Windows 1.8.2</a> fixes a bug: Reloading / Refreshing the current page in the browser window by pressing the F5 key did not work. Now it is possible, provided that the F5 key is admitted. The new default setting for the F5 key is therefore &quot;enabled&quot;.</p>

          <p class="half_linespace"><a href="download_en.html#Windows">SEB Windows 1.8.1</a> fixes two bugs:</p>
          <ul id="seblist">
            <li>Clicking on the SEB icon of the user's desktop in some cases launched the SEB installer rather than the actual SEB application. Now the SEB installer creates a shortcut to the SEB application on the <strong>common</strong> desktop. Thus the SEB icon and shortcut are visible to <strong>all</strong> users, and clicking on this icon launches the SEB application as intended.</li>
            <li>When finishing, SEB restored the <strong>default</strong> registry values for Task Manager etc. (on the blue <em>Windows Security Screen</em>). Now, SEB instead restores the <strong>previous</strong> registry values (= the values before SEB was started).</li>

          <p><a href="download_en.html#MacOSX">SEB MacOSX 1.5</a> supports additional browser windows and improves integrity of the SEB environment by elevating all SEB windows on a higher windows level, improving suppression of other applications opening alert windows, requesting to become active and switch to foreground. New security features include clearing the clipboard,  blocking browsing forward/backward, preventing possible security holes in Flash content, offering fine grade settings for opening and blocking links in new browser windows and in addition the upload of files edited in third party applications was made easier and more secure.</p>

          <p><a href="download_en.html#Windows">SEB Windows 1.8</a> easens the configuration for the teacher. It is now possible     to do the configuration in a new GUI editor called <em>SebWindowsConfig.exe</em> using mouse clicks, without directly editing the initialisation files <em>SebStarter.ini</em> and <em>MsgHook.ini</em>. The file format of these ini files has been simplified and is now better human-readable. In addition to the full version of SEB (installation via .msi file), a classic portable version can be built (copying of a zip file without installation), which has less functionality.</p>

          <p><a href="download_en.html#Windows">SEB Windows 1.7</a> easens the configuration and deployment for the teacher. It is now possible     to modify the configuration files before rather than after   installation,   so the students can directly install SEB without   patching it by   additional configuration files after installation.   Also, an   Administrative Install via network is now possible. Downloading a zip file, as in former SEB versions up to 1.4.1.</p>

          <p>The latest versions of SEB for Windows and macOS can detect if they were started in a virtual instead of a native environment and refuse to start up. This VM Detector hinders manipulating SEB when used in unmanaged environments. </p>
          <p><strong>SEB Windows 1.6</strong> is multilingual (German, English, French menus and error   messages) based upon the current user default input language and contains further usability refinements, the VM Detector and improvements in the built-in XULRunner browser.</p>
