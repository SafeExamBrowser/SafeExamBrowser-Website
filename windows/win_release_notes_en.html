    <h5 id="sebh5">Release notes <a href="../download_en.html#Windows">Safe Exam Browser for Windows</a> version 2.3: </h5>
    <p>SEB 2.3 for Windows offers new features, which increase security and usability significantly.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Implemented private clipboard (optional, see Security tab). When enabled, cut/copy/paste works only with content inside the SEB browser, the private clipboard doesn't accept content from other applications or tools.</li>
      <li>Added zooming of browser windows using the Ctrl +/- shortcuts.</li>
      <li>Now the option &quot;Allow downloading and uploading files&quot; is supported in SEB for Windows, downloading and uploading  (only when the website is using standard form elements) files can be disabled with this option (Down-/Uploads tab).<br>
      </li>
      <li>The dialog &quot;Open File With... Safe Exam Browser&quot; is no longer displayed unless the option &quot;Open files after downloading&quot; is enabled (Down-/Uploads tab).<br>
      </li>
      <li>Enabled SpeechSynthesis API<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fixed issue when opening a PDF with a link to be opened in a new browser window (target = _blank or JavaScript open), a second, empty browser window was opened.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Deactivated printing in the built-in PDF.js viewer, as that opened a security hole.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Now it's possible to open an embedded PDF file (embedded Additional Resource) when starting a SEB session, instead of a Start URL.<br>
      </li>
      <li>mailto: links are now being ignored.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fixed bug with last allowed application not starting and all started applications not closing when using SEB without browser.<br>
      </li>
      <li>SEB now can connect to some servers which are using Basic Authentication.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fixed issue with quitting SEB when Firefox was running.<br>
      </li>
      <li>More eligible SSL/TLS certificates are displayed in the list &quot;Choose TLS/SSL certificate to embed into configuration...&quot; and the one for CA certificates in SEB Config Tool / Network / Certificates.</li>
    </ul>
			
    <h5 id="sebh5">Release notes <a href="../download_en.html#Windows">Safe Exam Browser for Windows</a> version 2.2.3: </h5>
    <p>Safe Exam Browser 2.2.3 for Windows is an <strong>important security update</strong> for SEB 2.2.x and SEB 2.1.8.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed an issue when calculating the Browser Exam Key (BEK) on Windows set to Swedish and probably Turkish. A different BEK was calculated on Windows set to such languages since SEB 2.2 and the check for detecting additional (irregular) files in SEB's program directory displayed a warning in SEB 2.2.2.</li>
  <li>Added settings option to switch off detector for RDP/remote session (SEB Config Tool / Security / Allow screen sharing).</li>
  <li>Security improvements important mainly when running SEB on managed computers.</li>
  <li>The dialog "Open File With... Safe Exam Browser" is no longer displayed when downloading and opening .seb files.</li>
  <li>Closing the download dialog while loading a seb(s) link  doesn't prevent further reconfiguring anymore.</li>
  <li>Added settings options for all settings of the macOS 2.1.3 version to Config Tool / Security.</li>
</ul>

    <h5 id="sebh5">Release notes <a href="../download_en.html#Windows">Safe Exam Browser for Windows</a> version 2.2.2: </h5>
    <p>Safe Exam Browser 2.2.2 for Windows is a maintenance update for SEB 2.2 and two bug fixes for SEB 2.2.1:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed an issue in calculating the Browser Exam Key (BEK) in the SEB Config Tool, which happens when the config file contains explicit or implicit seb2 filter rules (key whitelistURLFilter and/or urlFilterTrustedContent, not visible in Config Tool). As this filter rules could slightly differ (Windows/macOS escape characters) or the key urlFilterTrustedContent can be undefined (because it doesn't have a function if URL filtering isn't enabled) and they were not updated in any case before calculating the BEK, it could differ in the SEB Config Tool vs. SEB Client.</li>
      <li>Added a check for detecting additional files in SEB's program directory (which might have been left there when updating from an older SEB version) and displaying a warning in that case. Such left over files cause a wrong Browser Exam Key as well.</li>
      <li>Fixed an issue when en-US was always selected as spell checking language, even if not allowed in settings, when starting SEB first time or after the contents of the Firefox Profiles folder were removed. </li>
      <li>Added tool tips to Additional Resources tab in SEB Config Tool.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5 id="sebh5">Release notes <a href="../download_en.html#Windows">Safe Exam Browser for Windows</a> version 2.2.1: </h5>
    <p>Safe Exam Browser 2.2.1 for Windows is a maintenance update for SEB 2.2 with some new features and many improvements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Added  spell checking with configurable languages, additional dictionaries can be embedded into SEB config files. </li>
      <li>Added context menu for displaying word suggestions and selecting spell checking dictionary. Note: You have to enable the right mouse button in &quot;Hooked Keys&quot; config tool tab (from SEB 2.2 in default settings the right mouse button is enabled, but not in older versions).</li>
      <li>Resolved issue with sometimes missing power options after SEB was quit</li>
      <li>Added options for additional resources: 
        <ul>
          <li>Show button (to display the icon or menu entry for a resource)</li>
          <li>Referrer filter for activation Link URL</li>
          <li>Option &quot;Show confirm box&quot; with custom text which is displayed before loading a resource</li>
          <li>Reset browser session (session cookies are deleted before loading a new resource)<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Fixed that the URL filter didn't treat query strings in URLs consistently in SEB for Windows 2.2/macOS. Added option to explicitly forbid any query part in checked URL: Indicate &quot;?.&quot; as query in your filter expression.</li>
      <li>Fixed Browser Exam Key (BEK) check wasn't working correctly with some exam systems (because a trailing slash &quot;/&quot; was removed from the URL used to hash the BEK)</li>
      <li>Fixed that SEB couldn't quit Firefox when starting. </li>

    <h5>Release notes <a href="../download_en.html#Windows">Safe Exam Browser for Windows</a> version 2.2: </h5>

    <p>SEB 2.2 for Windows is a major update with new features and many improvements. This version is replacing the SEB 2.1.x branch, with which it is compatible with one important exception: If you defined URL filter rules in SEB 2.1.x for Windows, then you'll have to re-enter those in the 2.2 SEB Config Tool, following the new filter rule scheme. URL filter rules created and saved with SEB for macOS are already compatible with SEB 2.2 for Windows.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>With the powerful new feature &quot;Additional Resources&quot;, you can configure  SEB to access specific webpages, full or partial websites and documents   securely and easily in exams. </li>
      <li>Additional Resources can be opened using icons in the SEB task bar (similar to permitted applications) or with hierarchical popup menus.</li>
      <li>External Additional Resources use the improved URL filter to only allow displaying specific webpages, documents or sections of websites.</li>
      <li>Additional Resources can be embedded into SEB configuration files. An exam administrator can add documents like PDF files and HTML documents.</li>
      <li>Even full HTML5 web apps can be added as embedded Additional Resources, so they can be used in a fully offline exam scenario.</li>
      <li>You could deploy SEB Config Files containing an  HTML5/JavaScript exam player onto mobile devices and then perform an offline e-assessment. The commercial exam solution Inspera Assessment is already supporting this.</li>
      <li>Improved URL filter which allows to use simple filter rules to effectively allow specific web pages/sites/content and block all others.</li>
      <li>Improved, refactored browser engine based on Firefox 52 ESR. This is the last Firefox version compatible with the XUL browser engine application used in SEB. We are already working on the next generation of SEB for Windows, which will be using a Chromium based browser engine (but this SEB 3.x branch won't replace the current Firefox-based SEB before 2019).</li>
      <li>Improved blocking of third party applications and tools for screen sharing and screen recording.</li>
      <li>Now preventing SEB being run in a remote session (using Remote Desktop Connection or similar on an exam client).</li>
      <li>Improved stability when setting and resetting Windows Registry settings to disable options like Task Manager, Switch User, Sign out and Shut down (accessible with the Ctrl+Alt+Del shortcut) during the exam and re-enabling them when quitting SEB.</li>
      <li>Integrated secure viewer for PDF files.</li>
      <li>Added Audio Control Component to SEB task bar, which allows to increase/decrease and mute system audio volume. Audio can be muted or the audio level preset when starting SEB.</li>
      <li>SEB Config Files can now be loaded from servers using authentication (Basic, OAuth etc.) using seb(s):// links. Even indirect links (not containing the  file name with the .seb extension, like for example sebs://example.com/download.php?id=2352) are possible. This allows to store a SEB exam settings file for example into the same Moodle course as the quiz. The login session is remembered, therefore students don't have to login twice in SEB if you start an exam using a seb(s):// link to a config file on an authenticated server. Note: Starting SEB by opening a seb(s):// linked config file from an authenticated server isn't supported in SEB for Windows 2.2 yet, such indirect seb(s) links can only be opened from inside SEB (for example from an exam portal/landing page).</li>
      <li>Added a page loading (network activity) indicator.</li>
      <li>Added a browser window toolbar, similar to SEB for macOS, with reload and back/forward buttons.</li>
      <li>Navigation in browser history (back/forward) can now be allowed/disabled separately for the exam and additional browser windows.</li>
      <li>The browser user agent string now reflects the operating system SEB is running on and allows a custom suffix string to be added.</li>
      <li>Added new asymmetric/symmetric encryption for config files using identity certificate for better performance when decrypting certificate encrypted config files.</li>
      <li>Fixed on-screen keyboard wasn't displayed in latest versions of Windows 10. Now "Tablet Mode" needs to be activated in the system when using SEB in its "Touch optimized" mode.</li>
      <li>Added spell checking dictionaries in addition to US English for Danish, English UK/Canada/Australia, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Swedish, Swedish (Finnland) (da, en-AU, en-GB, en-US, es-ES, fr-classic, pt-PT, sv, sv_FI). Some dictionaries for other languages cannot be distributed together with SEB, because they are only available under a GPL license which isn't compatible with SEB's MPL license. Currently only incorrectly written words get underlined with the usual red dotted line. The spell checking language cannot be selected manually yet, the default language indicated by the web site (for example &lt;html lang="en-UK"&gt;) is used for spell checking.</li>
      <li>Fixed performance issue with application switching mechanism (ALT+TAB) causing Windows to overlay its task switcher over the SEB one.</li>
      <li>Fixed and slightly changed functionality of setting &ldquo;Download and open SEB Config Files&rdquo;, which now also controls if SEB can be started with opening seb(s):// config links and .seb config files. The setting is now also respected when a .seb file is downloaded and opened inside of the running SEB.</li>
      <li>Now logging all SEB files which are used for generating the Browser Exam Key.</li>
      <li>Fixed that some dialogs (reconfiguring not allowed etc.) were not displayed in the foreground, but hidden behind the browser window and were only accessible using Alt+Tab.</li>
      <li>Changed Base16 encoding of SEB passwords to use lower case letters a-f (following web standards and macOS/iOS) instead of Microsofts non-standard upper case letters.</li>
      <li>Added "Allow reload in exam&ldquo;, "Allow reload in additional window&ldquo;, &ldquo;Show reload warning in exam&rdquo; and &ldquo;Show reload warning in additional window&rdquo; options to Config Tool / Browser.</li>
      <li>Localized also all UI strings in Win Forms in SEB Client to German.</li>
      <li>Now maximizing browser windows if their size is configured to be 100% width and height.</li>
      <li>Quit Link sometimes not exiting SEB: Also removing trailing slashes before comparing request URLs to the quit URL.</li>
      <li>Now trimming trailing slashes &ldquo;/&ldquo; from URL before applying URL filter (this wasn't the case in SEB 2.1.x and could lead to incompatibilities to URL filter rules generated in SEB for macOS).</li>
      <li>Changed default settings for hooked keys ESC and right mouse key to enabled (true).</li>
      <li>Now passing system language locale correctly to web pages in browser.</li>
      <li>Added some Firefox settings to improve Service Worker support.</li>
      <li>Changed reload in seb2 from hard reload to soft reload (to not break Service Worker when offline).</li>
      <li>Removed SEB for macOS settings in Config Tool / Browser for new browser windows opened by JavaScript/Plugins.</li>
      <li>Added improved logging for the embedded browser. Note: The log path cannot be changed in exam settings, SEB now uses always the path (and log enable option) which is configured in client config.</li>
      <li>In the native HTML full screen mode, the SEB task bar is also hidden now. Please note: You have to enable the "Esc" key in SEB settings if full screen mode on your website can only be exit using the key (otherwise provide a button on the webpage!).</li>
      <li>Added "Firefox/xx" to the default browser user agent strings for better compatibility.</li>
      <li>In the "iPad" setting option for the user agent for touch/tablet mode, the default iPad user agent string can be edited in the Config Tool / Browser pane.</li>
      <li>Added new option to Config Tool / Config File pane to use old asymmetric-only encryption (for compatibility with SEB &lt; 2.2).</li>
      <li>SEB now deletes the browser profile folder when updating SEB, to prevent problems with not updated, cached browser modules.</li>
      <li>SEB Registry Resetter now exits when a non-existing/wrong user name is entered.</li>
      <li>Added another method to find out the SID of the current user and send it to the SEBWindowsService. This is an addition to the username, because the translation from username to SID inside the Service sometimes fails.</li>
      <li>The desktop background picture is now also removed on PCs running Windows 7.</li>
      <li>If SEB cannot terminate or force quit prohibited applications (Config Tool / Applications / Prohibited Processes) because they are running with other user permissions, then the exam is blocked and SEB asks to enter the quit/restart password (which exam supervisors/supporters should know) to continue.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 id="sebh5">&nbsp;</h5>
    <h5>Release notes <a href="../download_en.html#Windows">Safe Exam Browser for Windows</a> version 2.1.8.1: </h5>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li>Re-integrated the &quot;Create New Desktop&quot; kiosk mode and declared dpi-awareness to resolve mouse pointer offset.</li>
  <li>Adding strictly prohibited default processes (screen sharing and communication tools) unconditionally to settings, default prohibited browser processes only in Disable Explorer Shell kiosk mode. If you need to allow one of these processes, then just deselect the &quot;Active&quot; flag of that process in Applications/Prohibited Processes.</li>
  <li>Now removing prohibited default browser processes in SEB Config Tool conditionally (if admin user confirms) from settings when loading config file which has Create new desktop kiosk mode set or when switching to Create new desktop (in Security tab).</li>
  <li>Process monitoring is now always active if either of the two kiosk modes is set.</li>
  <li>Fixed a security issue, now checking if SEB windows use original filename as well.</li>
  <li>Fixed dialog for entering settings password (if displayed when starting SEB) had a wrong scale if the system DPI ratio was different than 100%.</li>
  <li>Added monitoring of Windows File Explorer to prevent rare cases when explorer.exe was restarted, the shortcuts Win+Tab and Win+D and &quot;Sticky Keys&quot; were working.</li>
  <li>Fixed that the wrong permitted process was automatically started (with autostart property set) when the SEB browser is deactivated.</li>
  <li>Fixed quitting SEB didn't quit some permitted processes like Acrobat Reader.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="sebh5">Release notes <a href="../download_en.html#Windows">Safe Exam Browser for Windows</a> version 2.1.7: </h5>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li>Now adding list of prohibited (browser) processes automatically to all config files which SEB Client or SEB Config Tool opens, unless a prohibited process with the same name already exists. If you need to allow one of these processes, then just deselect the &quot;Active&quot; flag of that process in the list of prohibited processes.</li>
  <li>Automatically disabling Chrome notifications using a Registry setting.</li>
  <li>Added new settings sub-key originalName to permitted and prohibited processes.</li>
  <li>Improved detecting permitted and prohibited processes, file name extensions are now stripped from executable and original filenames before comparing to running processes. </li>
  <li>Fixed error when displaying which running processes must be terminated before starting exam.</li>
  <li>Added verification of original filename when allowing user to choose path to third-party application.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug caused by case-sensitive string comparison when allowing user to choose path to allowed application.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug for terminating permitted applications when quitting SEB.</li>
  <li>Fixed autostart error when using SEB 2.2 generated settings with SEB 2.1.7. If permitted process firefox.exe for SEB browser was contained in settings (because those were created in SEB 2.2), the permitted process following SEB/firefox.exe in the list of permitted processes was auto-started, even if that flag wasn’t set.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="sebh5">Release notes <a href="../download_en.html#Windows">Safe Exam Browser for Windows</a> version 2.1.6: </h5>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li>Removed &quot;Create new desktop&quot; kiosk mode which fixes the mouse offset problem introduced by the recent Windows Creators Update. The mouse cursor had an offset if the display scale factor was set to a different value than 100% and SEB was using the default &quot;Create new desktop&quot; kiosk mode. For compatibility with older SEB versions, you can still select this kiosk mode in the SEB Config Tool, but SEB 2.1.6 ignores this setting.</li>
  <li>Added support for HTML 5 webcam and microphone access with new SEB settings in SEB Config Tool / Browser / Browser security / Allow video capture (webcam) &amp; Allow audio capture (microphone). New setting keys allowVideoCapture (in seb browser mapped to media.navigator.video.enabled) and allowAudioCapture (mapped to media.getusermedia.audiocapture.enabled), and set media.navigator.permission.disabled to true (prerequisite for video and audio capture to work in SEB, as the Firefox “allow” alert is not being displayed in SEB).</li>
  <li>Now ignoring SEB/firefox.exe entry from permittedProcesses, which fixes error message when using SEB 2.2 generated settings with SEB 2.1.6.</li>
  <li>Improved compatibility with SEB 2.2 generated settings: Removing additionalResources from settings sent to browser.</li>
  <li>The SEB icon in the SEB task bar is now always leftmost, even if it isn't the first entry in the permittedProcesses setting.</li>
  <li>Fixed SEB doesn't doesn't finish starting up properly when it can't add some permitted applications (which have been removed but not properly uninstalled).</li>
  <li>Fixed again wrong Browser Exam Key calculation after update by really performing a major update (completely removing old version's files).</li>
  <li>Updated seb XUL browser application to current status.</li>
  <li>Set Gecko/Firefox setting &quot;dom.serviceWorkers.enabled&quot; to true.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="sebh5">Release notes <a href="../download_en.html#Windows">Safe Exam Browser for Windows</a> version 2.1.5: </h5>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li>Fixed that for some third party applications new instances were started when clicking the icon in the task bar (instead switching to the window of the already running instance).</li>
  <li>Fixed: Already running instances of permitted applications were not quit when SEB starts and were accessible inside SEB. Also fixed this for prohibited applications.</li>
  <li>Fixed some config tool UI issues: Radio buttons for Zoom Page/Text and User Agent were sometimes not set properly after loading a new config file, main browser window size wasn't disabled when using full screen mode.</li>
  <li>Added Gecko setting for HTTP2 (network.http.spdy.enabled.http2) to XUL seb config file prefs.js. Currently not changing default true to false, despite some unconfirmed information that HTTP2 doesn’t work in Gecko &lt;= 48. Please let us know if you have a reproducible case where HTTP2 doesn't work with SEB 2.1.5.</li>
  <li>Added MIME type application/seb to the .seb file type which the installer registers.</li>
  <li>Fixed in Network/Filter: If editing a filter rule (block/allow), the Config Tool didn't save this edited rule when using commands Save, Save As, closing the Config Tool, Open Settings (with button, menu and drag-and-drop), Revert Settings to Default/Local Client/Last Opened, Use Current Settings to Edit Duplicate/Configure Client/Apply and Start SEB.</li>
  <li>In the following cases also added checking for unconfirmed passwords: Open Settings (with button, menu and drag-and-drop), Revert Settings to Default/Local Client/Last Opened, Use Current Settings to Edit Duplicate/Configure Client/Apply and Start SEB.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="sebh5">Release notes <a href="../download_en.html#Windows">Safe Exam Browser for Windows</a> version 2.1.4: </h5>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li>Added all new setting options of SEB 2.1.2 for macOS to SEB Config Tool.</li>
  <li>Changed „Restart Exam Button“ title and icon to „Back to Start Button“, added disclaimer about this function not logging out a previously logged in user.</li>
  <li>Added Gecko/Firefox setting &quot;browser.display.use_document_fonts = 1&quot;, to allow pages to choose their own fonts.</li>
  <li> SEB now looks for X.509 identity certificates for decrypting an identity-encrypted config file also in the &quot;Trusted People&quot; store in the Windows Certificate Store (in addition to the default &quot;Personal&quot; store). On managed computers this allows to deploy the identity certificate to the &quot;Local Machine/Trusted People&quot; store when installing SEB in an administrator account. The certificate will then also be available in the &quot;Current User/Trusted People&quot; stores of all currently existing user accounts on that machine.</li>
  <li>The SEB installer doesn't create the %APPDATA%\SafeExamBrowser\ directory anymore when it wasn't existing. This was the reason that Windows Installer shortly started and &quot;updated&quot; the SEB installation when starting SEB the first time in another user account than the one where SEB was installed. Please note that if deploying SEB on managed computers, Windows Installer will start and install .NET 4.5 on a Windows 7 system which didn't had this .NET version installed yet and will require a restart. So make sure that when deploying SEB on Windows 7 computers, .NET 4.5 is also deployed.</li>
  <li>The SEB installer doesn't create a SEB shortcut on the desktop anymore. Users can start SEB directly from the Windows Start Menu / Windows Start Screen (a menu entry/tile for SEB is still created). As before, it can make sense to start SEB by opening a SEB config file or by opening a seb(s):// link from another web browser or mail application. </li>
  <li> Fixed that some permitted applications could not be immediately restarted after being quit. </li>
  <li> Fixed a problem which caused the Browser Exam Key to be different when SEB was updated from an older version than when it was installed freshly. SEB 2.1.4 can be updated from 2.1.1, 2.1.2 or 2.1.3. A direct update from SEB 2.1 might fail, so uninstall SEB 2.1 first using the Windows control panel before installing SEB 2.1.4.</li>
  <li> Fixed a problem when switching keyboards didn't work properly when using specific keyboard layouts (at least when running on Windows 10). </li>
  <li> Fixed: Registry Resetter didn't complain and just did nothing when an inexistent username has been typed in. Added additional output for debugging.</li>
  <li> Fixed a problem which caused SEB Windows Service to crash rarely.</li>
  <li> Fixed starting the socket server after closing already running processes. This way if an instance of the browser is already running, it gets closed before starting the socket server and an error about a blocked port does not appear.</li>
  <li> The installer now always performs a &quot;major update&quot;, which guarantees all older files are replaced with the new ones.</li>
  <li>&quot;Monitor Processes&quot; is now always active when &quot;Disable Explorer Shell&quot; is selected as kiosk mode.</li>
  <li> Changed title of setting in Config Tool / Exams to &quot;Use Browser Exam Key (send in HTTP header)&quot; according to Mac version and moved checkbox up, to be the first setting in the Browser Exam Key group box. Disabling this setting also disables the Browser Exam Key text field now. </li>
  <li> Log SEB version in log file.</li>
  <li> Write log file directly after starting SEB. Logging initially starts in the standard log directory, even if settings define another log file path.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="sebh5">Release notes <a href="../download_en.html#Windows">Safe Exam Browser for Windows</a> version 2.1.3: </h5>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li>Current versions of Internet Explorer, Edge and Windows 10 complained about an invalid signature of the SEB installer when downloading or starting it. Reason: Windows doesn't accept executables signed with code signing certificates using an insecure SHA-1 signature since a security update from January 12, 2016 (if the executable was signed using SHA-1 after this date). SEB is now signed with a new code signing certificate with a SHA-256 signature.</li>
  <li> Added support for system proxy settings (the existing option in SEB Config Tool / Network / Proxies is functional now).</li>
  <li> SEB Windows service didn't start properly on some machines (SID could not be determined using the user name), this should be fixed now. Please report if single users are still having problems with the SEB Windows Service (warning or error message when starting SEB): http://safeexambrowser.org/support</li>
  <li> Fixed URL of SEBWindowsServiceWCF to avoid collisions with other WCF services. This might have caused SEB influencing some other installed applications.</li>
  <li> Improved stability of resetting registry settings when SEB quits or is started/quit again after not being exited properly.</li>
  <li> Fixed wrong version number in SEB installer.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="sebh5">Release notes <a href="../download_en.html#Windows">Safe Exam Browser for Windows</a> version 2.1.2:</h5>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li>Native HTML5 full screen mode is now supported. Please note: The SEB task bar (if enabled) is not hidden by this full screen mode. To be able to exit the full screen mode, the Esc key needs to be enabled in SEB settings. Alternatively the full screen view should contain a button to close it.</li>
  <li>Hardware accelaration is now activated in the SEB browser.</li>
  <li>Fixed problem not recognizing a quit URL  if the quit link was not clicked by the user but the quit URL directly loaded on the website.</li>
  <li>Fixed problem (displaying an exception message) when selecting a network in the SEB Wi-Fi task bar control.</li>
  <li>Fixed cancel button in the dialog window for the restart exam button.</li>
  <li>The option &quot;Monitor processes while SEB is running&quot; in the Applications config tool tab cannot be altered when the kiosk mode &quot;Disable Explorer Shell&quot; is active, as process monitoring is always active in this kiosk mode.</li>
</ul>

      <li>Not hiding and showing onscreen keyboard again when clicking from one text field to another.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug which stopped the keyboard from being displayed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A new setting allows to switch off the on-screen keyboard manually or automatically when a hardware keyboard is connected.</li>
  <li>Added a <span class="quote">sebs://</span> protocol (in addition to <span class="quote">seb://</span>), which forces the use of https for loading a <span class="quote">.seb</span> configuration file.</li>
  <li>Updated browser engine to XULRunner/Gecko (Firefox) 41.0.2. </li>
  <li>Improved logging feature, the log is now better readable.</li>
  <li>Added confirm restart exam dialog when quit/restart password is not set.</li>
  <li>Add alert if entering wrong   quit/restart password for restart exam.</li>
  <li>Config Tool: Changed default setting for &quot;Use SEB settings for...&quot; as local client settings usually should be saved &quot;for configuring client&quot; (like that they are encrypted without having to enter a password).</li>
  <li>Changed default value for setting option &quot;Use Start URL&quot; for restart exam button to disabled (Exam tab): In default settings now the restart exam button isn't displayed.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug which  caused options in the Windows Security Screen (Ctrl-Alt-Delete) not being restored after a reset/reboot.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug which caused SEB being opened multiple times by quickly double clicking more than once.</li>

<ul id="seblist">
    <li>When you start SEBConfigTool.exe, it loads the local client settings, which are saved at the path <span class="path">C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\SafeExamBrowser\SebClientSettings.seb</span>.</li>
    <li>There are new functions for working with configuration files (<span class="quote">Open, Save, Save As, Revert Settings to... Default Settings; Local Client Settings; Last Opened, Use Current Settings to... Edit Duplicate, Configure Client, Apply and Start SEB</span>). These functions are accessible at any point when working in the SEB Config Tool with a new menu bar, with shortcuts or as buttons in the Config File tab. </li>
    <li>If you changed settings, the Config Tool will ask you to save unsaved changes before quitting or reverting to other settings.</li>
    <li>SEB Config Tool now supports opening .seb config files with drag-and-drop (into the window or onto the application's icon).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Renamed Appearance tab to <strong>User Interface</strong>: 
  </p>
  <ul id="seblist">
      <li>Added option &quot;Touch optimized&quot; to Browser view modes to switch on the tablet mode of SEB.</li>
      <li>Added option &quot;Enable touch exit&quot;, when enabled SEB can be quit in touch optimized mode with a swipe down from the upper display edge (helpful, when the SEB task bar with the quit button is not used).</li>
      <li>Added settings group for SEB task bar for all new controls (see above). </li>
      <li>Task bar height in pixels can now be changed for high resolution displays (display DPI settings are now also taken in account, in touch optimized mode task bar is scaled up in addition).</li>
      <li>Added settings options for switching between zooming the full web page or just changing text sizes. </li>
      <li>Zooming can also be disabled optionally (not recommended in most exam scenarios because of accessibility).</li>
      <li>Added option to disable the browser spell check.</li>
      <li>Added setting option for new Mac-only feature &quot;Allow dictionary lookup&quot;.</li>
    </ul>
  <p><strong>Browser</strong> tab in SEB Config Tool: 
  </p>
  <ul id="seblist">
      <li>Added settings to switch between default and custom browser user agent strings, separately for desktop and touch modes (and for SEB on Macs). </li>
      <li>In touch mode, there is also an option for an iPad user agent string, as many mobile optimized websites recognize this user agent, but not the Windows touch user agent. </li>
      <li>SEB now also adds its version number to the user agent string.</li>
      <li>Removed option &quot;block when directing to a different server&quot; for the option &quot;Links in JavaScript/plug-ins&quot; (Mac only feature).<br />
      </li>
    </ul>
  <p><strong>Exam</strong> tab in SEB Config Tool:
  </p>
  <ul id="seblist">
      <li>Restart exam button: Either check the &quot;Use Start URL&quot; option or enter a link to which the exam is redirected when the restart exam button is pressed. The restart exam button is displayed in the SEB task bar when either the &quot;Use Start URL&quot; option is selected or a link is entered.</li>
      <li>You can add a custom title and tool tip text, for example if the button/link doesn't restart the exam but redirects to some other specific page, submits the exam etc.</li>
      <li>You can select the option to protect the restart exam button with the quit/restart password. Exam support/invigilators could be told this password to be able to restart the exam if there is a problem.<br />
      </li>
    </ul>
  <p><strong>Applications/Permitted Processes</strong> tab in SEB Config Tool: 
  </p>
  <ul id="seblist">
      <li>Added option &quot;Monitor processes while SEB is running&quot;. If enabled, SEB prevents non-permitted processes to display any windows (including alerts, message boxes etc.) by hiding them immediately. If SEB cannot hide such a process (because it is running with the rights of another user, for example SYSTEM) SEB terminates it. For the &quot;Disable Explorer Shell&quot; kiosk mode (see Security tab), &quot;Monitor processes...&quot; should always be activated (which was implicitly the case in former SEB versions), but in SEB 2.1 you can (and should in most cases) use this feature also with the &quot;Create new desktop&quot; kiosk mode. </li>
      <li>Added button &quot;Choose Application...&quot;. When you select a third party application which is permitted to run during the exam using this button, the parameters for executable and path are automatically set according to the selected executable (.exe) file, considering if and which path of that application is registered in Windows (usually no path or only a relative path to the Windows registered path of that application needs to be entered in the field for &quot;Path&quot;).</li>
      <li>Added option &quot;Icon in task bar&quot; for permitted processes. Mainly useful for background processes (not requiring user interaction) which you want to autostart when SEB is run.</li>
      <li>Added option &quot;Allow running in background&quot;. Permitted processes with this option set are allowed to already be running when starting SEB. In this case SEB doesn't ask the user if the process can be terminated before continuing to start SEB. Processes with the option &quot;Allow running in background&quot; don't have an icon in the SEB task bar. They can nevertheless have the option &quot;Autostart&quot; set, in this case SEB attempts to start the permitted process regardless if it was already running or not (and the option &quot;Icon in task bar&quot; is considered in this case). If you need some background process running together with SEB and this process might display some window or alert/message box, you have to add this process's executable to permitted processes with the option &quot;Allow running in background&quot; set, otherwise SEB will hide the window of the background process when &quot;Monitor processes&quot; is selected (or even terminate that process, in case it cannot be hidden). </li>
      <li>Improved handling of permitted processes and their open windows, when switching between them using the app/window chooser (Alt-Tab) or the icons of these permitted applications in the SEB task bar. Some applications (for example Adobe Acrobat or applications based on Java like Open Office or Eclipse) still need special settings in the Applications/Permitted Processes tab in SEB Config Tool in the fields &quot;Window handling process&quot; (the executable of the main process of that application) and &quot;Identifier&quot; (substring which is displayed in every window the application opens).<br />
      </li>
    </ul>
  <p><strong>Network/Filter</strong> tab in SEB Config Tool: 
  </p>
  <ul id="seblist">
      <li>Added tables for Allow and Block URL filter rules. </li>
      <li>Added new option &quot;Rules are regular expressions&quot;: If not enabled, then the rules can be formatted using the wildcard '*', which stands for an arbitrary string of any length.<br />
      </li>
    </ul>
  <p><strong>Network/Certificates</strong> tab in SEB Config Tool: <br />
    SEB 2.1 supports embedding TLS/SSL and encrypting identity certificates into .seb files. 
  </p>
  <ul id="seblist">
      <li>Choose TLS/SSL certificate to embed into configuration... Here you can choose SSL server certificates which are stored in the Windows Certificate Store (if you have a certificate file, you first need to import it to the Windows Certificate Store, depending on the format you can just double click such a certificate file to invoke the Windows certificate import assistant). The certificates added to this table will be included into a .seb settings file when it is saved and used on the SEB clients which are started up with that .seb exam configuration. Users won't be presented a warning then when connecting to https servers with self-signed certificates and you don't need to distribute SSL certificates manually to the exam client computers.</li>
      <li>Choose identity to embed into configuration... You can also choose cryptographic identities stored in the Windows Certificate Store which are suitable for decrypting .seb files on SEB exam clients (X.509 certificates with RSA public key and associated private key). If you have a .p12 or .pfx certificate archive file, you first need to import it into the Windows Certificate Store (usually you can just double click such a certificate file to invoke the Windows certificate import assistant). When importing the .p12/.pfx identity file, the included private key must be marked as &quot;exportable&quot;. The identities added to this table will be embedded into the .seb settings file. Use this feature for creating a .seb file for configuring a client and add the identity or identities you like to use for encrypting/decrypting .seb files for starting exams later. When opening this .seb file on your exam clients, the embedded identities will be imported into the Windows Certificate Store (or Keychain on Macs), so that they can be used for decrypting exam settings later. Please note that during this process the private keys imported into the Windows Certificate Store of the exam clients will be flagged as non-exportable for increased security. </li>
      <li>SEB now finds identities (and certificates) stored in the current user's and local machine Certificate Store.<br />
      </li>
    </ul>
  <p><strong>Network/Proxies</strong> tab in SEB Config Tool: 
  </p>
  <ul id="seblist">
      <li>Now HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and SOCKS proxies (without authentication) are supported when using the option &quot;Use SEB proxy settings&quot;. </li>
      <li>The proxy host/domain bypass list is supported now.<br />
      </li>
    </ul>
<p><strong>Installer</strong>:
</p>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li>The SEB installer now updates an existing SEB installation automatically, so an older SEB version doesn't need to be uninstalled first.</li>
  <li>Fixed installing SEB in an administrator (or other) account didn't set filetype for .seb config files  correctly in another user account (double clicking a .seb file displayed a dialog to locate a SEB .msi installer file and only after that fixed the filetype binding for that account).</li>
  <li>Changed properties for SEBRegistryResetter shortcut to prevent it showing up in recently opened programs in the Windows 7 start menu.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Further bugfixes:</strong></p>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li>Quit and settings password dialogs now have keyboard focus when they appear, so it's usually not necessary to click them first before starting to type.</li>
  <li>Fixed SEB browser sometimes wasn't closed quickly enough and then displayed an unnecessary &quot;do you really want to quit&quot; or quit password dialog.</li>
  <li>Fixed when opening a .seb file is canceled (Cancel button in password entry dialog), then SEB starts with only partially visible task bar stub on the upper left screen corner and freezes (cannot be quit).</li>
  <li> Fixed SEB was quit when loading a .seb file (by seb:// link) and user canceled entering settings password</li>
  <li> Fixed a security issue with the settings key browserURLSalt.</li>
  <li> Fixed asking for current or admin password in settings even though that is an empty string.</li>
  <li> Fixed a security issue where a .seb file for configuring client encrypted with an arbitrary password could reconfigure a client without having to enter the admin pw saved currently in SEB on that client. Now this is only possible after entering the current admin pw or by encrypting the new settings for configuring the client with that current admin pw.</li>
  <li> Fixed bugs when reconfiguring client settings, when admin pw differs in new and current settings and user is asked to enter the current admin pw.</li>
  <li> Fixed process name was not listed in dialog &quot;Permitted Processes Are Already Running&quot; and in the dialog when permitted process couldn't be found if it didn't had a title property: Now using executable in the case there's no title.</li>
  <li> Fixed SEB sometimes didn't exit completely when quitting.</li>
  <li> Fixed when loading a .seb file with entering settings password, selecting cancel results in SEB being quit.</li>
  <li> Fixed generating XULRunner seb URL filter whitelist string when the Start URL is not contained in a filter rule and fixed connection with web socket server is not possible when the content filter is active.<br />
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>Known issues in SEB 2.1 for Windows:</strong></p>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li> The on-screen keyboard does not appear automatically when clicking into some text input fields, for example some web rich text editors as used in Moodle for the free text question. Use the keyboard button in the SEB task bar in these cases to trigger the on-screen keyboard manually.</li>
  <li> In touch optimized mode, sometimes the on-screen keyboard stops being displayed. When this happens, SEB must be quit and the keyboard button in the Windows Explorer task bar needs to be clicked (then the keyboard appears). When closing the keyboard and restarting SEB, it is again being displayed inside SEB.</li>
  <li> Starting and reconfiguring SEB on Windows 10 takes much longer than usual.</li>
  <li> Disabling Windows Update while SEB is running does not work on Windows 10, it leads to a timeout (this is the reason for the delay when starting and reconfiguring SEB).</li>
  <li> When SEB is started twice (by quickly double clicking twice), Registry settings are messed up afterwards (options like Task Manager in the Windows Security Screen invoked with Ctrl-Alt-Del are no longer available). Use SEB Registry Resetter to fix this problem.</li>
  <li> Buttons for shutdown and restart are not hidden in the Windows 10 Security Screen (invoked with Ctrl-Alt-Del).</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="sebh5">Release notes <a href="../download_releases_en.html">Safe Exam Browser for Windows</a> version 2.0.3:</h5>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li>Improves general stability and compatibility with some exam systems.</li>
  <li>Allows current versions of Flash to run with SEB in both kiosk modes correctly. </li>
  <li>Updated browser engine to XULRunner/Gecko (Firefox) 36. </li>
  <li>Now Flash, Java and JavaScript can be enabled/disabled. </li>
  <li>Downloads window now is not opened when a download is started. This was a security issue as it was possible to open the downloaded file's folder.</li>
  <li>Bug fixes include a  rare keyboard bug,  another bug which sometimes caused options in the Windows Security Screen (Ctrl-Alt-Delete) missing after quitting SEB and an exception error message when using the WiFi control in the task bar and the WiFi connection drops. </li>
  <li>SEB 2.0.3 can  be used with the (currently experimental) <a href="https://github.com/timhunt/moodle-quizaccess_offlinemode" target="_blank">fault-tolerant mode Moodle quiz plugin</a>, which allows to continue quizzes even if the internet connection to the Moodle server fails.</li>
</ul>
<p>Known issues in SEB 2.0.3 for Windows:</p>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li><strong>Always install SEB from a normal user account, not the administrator account</strong> (in case you have several users on your Windows machine). There is a problem in the installer which prevents other (non-administrative) users to double-click .seb files if SEB was installed from the administrator account.</li>
  <li>The network filter feature  has been reworked and will be fully available as by SEB 2.1. You can already use <a href="../macosx/mac_usermanual_v2_en.html#NetworkPaneFilterSection">SEB 2.0 for macOS</a> to define rules for the new URL filter.  Saved settings files will also work in SEB 2.0.3 for Windows.</li>
  <li>SEB 2.0.3 doesn't support embedding SSL and encrypting identity certificates into .seb files yet.</li>
  <li>In SEB 2.0.3, the proxy host/domain bypass list isn't utilized yet.</li>
  <li><strong>In the former version  SEB 2.0.2</strong> the communication with its background Windows service to trigger re-enabling  options like shutdown, task manager, switch user etc. (which are also visible after pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del) sometimes failed when  SEB was exiting. If those options (or some of them) are still not available before or after installing SEB 2.0.3, and running and quitting SEB or a reboot doesn't restore the options  to the original values, you should use  the <a href="http://www.safeexambrowser.org/windows/win_usermanual_en.html#RegistryPane">SebRegistryResetter</a> to solve the problem by resitting those values to the Windows defaults.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="sebh5">Release notes <a href="../download_en.html#Windows">Safe Exam Browser for Windows</a> version 2.0.2:</h5>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li>Fixed keyboard freezes (no text entering possible after pressing Alt-Ctrl twice).</li>
  <li>Fixed bug when in some cases restoring Windows Registry settings for options in the Windows Security Screen (invoked by Ctrl-Alt-Delete) failed, for example when SEB crashed or the PC was hard-reset while SEB was running. </li>
  <li>Added shortcuts to SEB Config Tool and SEB Registry Resetter to Windows 7 Start Menu programs folder.</li>
  <li>Added option &quot;Enable Alt-Mousewheel&quot; in SEB Config Tool -&gt; Hooked keys, removed &quot;Enable Alt-Ctrl&quot;.</li>
  <li>The built-in seb XULRunner browser now writes a browser log file (when &quot;Enable logging&quot; in Config Tool -&gt; Security is selected), the path of this seb.log file can also be chosen there.</li>
  <li>Added check box &quot;Use standard directory&quot; for the log file Win path (Config Tool -&gt; Security), this sets the AppData directory as location for the seb XULRunner browser seb.log log file.</li>
  <li>Added various setting options to match with final version of SEB 2.0 for macOS.</li>
  <li>New option &quot;Download and open .seb config files&quot; in Config Tool -&gt; Down/Uploads.</li>
  <li>Added default .seb config file filename &quot;SebClientSettings.seb&quot; when opening and saving config files in Config File pane.</li>
  <li>Updated XULRunner version to 33.</li>
  <li>Added &quot;Firefox/33.0 SEB&quot; to the browser agent string because some web applications like for example &quot;VMware Horizon View Web Access&quot; didn't identify the SEB browser correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong class="red">PLEASE NOTE:</strong> <span class="red">Every new SEB version generates a different Browser Exam Key</span> (as code and configuration option changes are reflected in the key, this is the idea of the request header check using this key together with compatible exam systems). If you want to use an existing exam configuration with SEB 2.0.2, you have to re-calculate the Browser Exam Key with SEB 2.0.2 and copy the new key to the quiz settings in your SEB compatible examination system (Moodle and ILIAS allow you to specify several keys in case you want to allow your examinees to use either SEB 2.0.1 or 2.0.2).<br />
</p>
<p>Known issues in SEB 2.0.2 for Windows:</p>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li>The network filter feature  has been reworked and will be fully available as by SEB 2.1.</li>
  <li>SEB 2.0.2 doesn't support embedding SSL and encrypting identity certificates into .seb files yet.</li>
  <li>In SEB 2.0.2, only HTTP and HTTPS proxies without authentication are supported when using the option &quot;Use SEB proxy settings&quot;. The proxy host/domain bypass list isn't utilized yet.</li>
  <li>Pressing Ctrl-Alt and some number key (which can be used on German/Swiss German/US International and other keyboards instead of the Alt Gr key) and possibly other key combinations lock the keyboard sometimes. It behaves like if the Ctrl key would constantly be held down, text entering isn't possible anymore.<br />
    This new kind of keyboard lock can usually be fixed by pressing Alt-Tab once. Another possible fix if this doesn't help is pressing Ctrl-Alt-Delete and then the cancel/back button.</li>
  <li>Sometimes the communication of SEB 2.0.2  with its background Windows service to trigger re-enabling  options like shutdown, task manager, switch user etc. (which are also visible after pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del) fails when  SEB is exiting. When those options (or some of them) are not available after quitting SEB (or if SEB crashed), then usually running and quitting SEB should restore them. After a reboot the options are also reset to the original values.<br />
    If this doesn't help then the <a href="http://www.safeexambrowser.org/windows/win_usermanual_en.html#RegistryPane">SebRegistryResetter</a> will solve the problem by resetting those values to the Windows defaults.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="sebh5">Release notes <a href="../download_en.html#Windows">Safe Exam Browser for Windows</a>  version 2.0.1:</h5>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li>Added &quot;Please Wait&quot; loading screen when SEB is reconfigured or quit. This prevents Windows from telling that the application is not responding and asking users if they want to quit it.</li>
  <li>Fixes in certificate management in SEB Config Tool: Display SerialNumber if no FriendlyName is available in a certificate, fix in selecting the correct certificate when loading the .seb file.</li>
  <li>Added basic support for individual SEB proxy settings in .seb config files. In SEB Config Tool -&gt; Network -&gt; Proxies you can currently specify a proxy server address and port for HTTP and HTTPS, auto proxy discovery and automatic proxy configuration. Currently only HTTP and HTTPS proxies without proxy authentication are supported and the proxy host/domain bypass list isn't utilized yet.</li>
  <li>Added new option in SEB Config Tool -&gt; Browser -&gt; &quot;Remove profile&quot; which deletes contents of the seb XULRunner embedded browser profile directory (cache, cookies, local browser storage etc.) when exiting SEB.</li>
  <li>In SEB installer removed second SEB shortcut from Windows Start Menu (left the one in Start Menu -&gt; Programs Menu).</li>
  <li>Updated XULRunner version to 31.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug in SEB Config Tool which caused a crash if loading settings was aborted and then user started to entering settings manually.</li>
  <li>Now arguments for XULRunner can be specified containing Windows environment variables for paths (for example in Config Tool Applications -&gt; Permitted Processes -&gt; xulrunner.exe, new argument: -profile &quot;%LOCALAPPDATA%\SafeExamBrowser\Profiles&quot;).</li>
  <li>Improved compatibility of .seb config file format with the upcoming SEB 2.0 RC/final release version for macOS.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Known issues in SEB 2.0.1 for Windows:</p>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li>In some cases, usually after pressing Alt-Ctrl twice, the keyboard seems to freeze (no text entering possible) in the SEB browser. Pressing Ctrl once more (or Alt-Tab or Windows-Tab) unfreezes it again. The new option to disable Ctrl-Alt doesn't solve the issue, it might even block unfreezing the keyboard.</li>
  <li>In some cases restoring Windows Registry settings for  options in the Windows Security Screen (invoked by Ctrl-Alt-Del) fails, for example when SEB crashes or the PC is hard-reset  while SEB is running. Then you cannot use the Task Manager or even log off/shut down. Usually after restarting SEB or rebooting the machine those Registry settings should be restored, but because of a bug in SEB 2.0.1 this sometimes fails. Please use the tool <a href="http://www.safeexambrowser.org/windows/win_usermanual_en.html#RegistryPane">SebRegistryResetter.exe</a> in those cases. This bug is fixed in SEB 2.1.</li>
  <li>The network filter feature isn't implemented yet in SEB 2.0.1, you cannot activate URL filtering. The functionality has been reworked and will be available as by SEB 2.1.</li>
  <li>SEB 2.0.1 doesn't support embedding SSL and encrypting identity certificates into .seb files yet.</li>
  <li>In SEB 2.0.1, only HTTP and HTTPS proxies without authentication are supported when using the option &quot;Use SEB proxy settings&quot;. The proxy host/domain bypass list isn't utilized yet.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="sebh5">Release notes <a href="../download_en.html#Windows">Safe Exam Browser for Windows</a> final release version 2.0:</h5>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li>Added tool tips to the SEB Config Tool.</li>
  <li>Added about SEB splash screen.</li>
  <li>Fixed option to disable the shade (menubar) for the new Horizon VMware Client. </li>
  <li>Minor bugfixes.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="sebh5">Release notes <a href="../download_en.html#Windows">Safe Exam Browser for Windows</a> version 2.0RC6:</h5>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li>Added optional WLAN control to the SEB task bar which allows to reconnect to WiFi networks which have previously been connected to (before using SEB), see settings pane <span class="quote">Security -&gt; Allow WLAN Control</span>.</li>
</ul>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li>SEB now pauses Windows Update and therefore prevents slowing down and sudden restarting of a machine during an exam.</li>
  <li>SEB now disables screen saver and idle sleep while SEB is running and hides the desktop wallpaper (in Windows 8).</li>
  <li>Java applications (like OpenOffice) can now be used as permitted processes, but require specific settings: The title of their main window must be defined in settings <span class="quote">Applications</span> pane in the field <span class="quote">Permitted Processes -&gt; Identifier</span> (for example &quot;OpenOffice Calc&quot;), the required main executable in <span class="quote">Permitted Processes -&gt; Executable</span> (&quot;scalc.exe&quot;) and the process which is actually handling the main window in <span class="quote">Permitted Processes -&gt; Window Handling Process(es)</span> (&quot;soffice.bin&quot;). For this example the executable path should be entered as &quot;program&quot; in <span class="quote">Permitted Processes -&gt; Path</span>, as that is the relative path to the main executable from the OpenOffice main directory, which is registered in Windows <span class="quote">App Paths</span>.</li>
  <li>Added new kiosk mode &quot;Disable Explorer Shell&quot; (<span class="quote">Security settings pane -&gt; Kiosk Mode: Disable Explorer Shell</span>) which doesn't rely on the &quot;Create new Desktop&quot; method and increases compatibility with screen recording proctoring software like ObserveIT.</li>
  <li>Added process monitoring for prohibited processes: Those will be closed when SEB is started up or when they start up while SEB is running.</li>
  <li>Improved stability and performance when starting, reconfiguring and quitting SEB and the build-in XULRunner seb browser component, which should reduce problems with the XULRunner seb profile folder being locked and producing error message that &quot;seb is already running&quot;.</li>
  <li>The Quit button in SEB task bar is now hidden when &quot;Allow user to quit SEB&quot; is disabled.</li>
  <li>Changed default setting for <span class="quote">Permitted Processes -&gt; Allow user to select location of application</span> to false.</li>
  <li>Tooltips in SEB task bar on the application icons are now always visible.</li>
  <li>Added Support for the new Horizon VMware Client to disable its shade (menubar).</li>
  <li>Removed SebWindowsToolkit with outdated Registry resetting batch files. Use <span class="path">SebRegistryResetter.exe</span> in the <span class="path">SafeExamBrowser\SebWindowsServiceWCF</span> directory instead (&quot;Run as administrator&quot; with right mouse button context menu, see RC5).</li>
  <li>Fixed bug when using browser in full screen mode, without SEB task bar and application chooser (Alt-Tab) which previously minimized the browser window.</li>
  <li>Various additional bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="sebh5">Release notes <a href="../download_en.html#Windows">Safe Exam Browser for Windows</a> version 2.0RC5:</h5>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li>Completely re-engineered SEB Windows Service with improved stability for setting and resetting options in the Windows Security Screen (invoked by Ctrl-Alt-Del), like Task Manager. In case of a SEB crash or enforced reset of the machine, those options are reset to the values which were active before SEB was used. This happens when SEB is started again and quit properly, after a reboot, or when uninstalling SEB.</li>
</ul>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li>Removed section &quot;Outside SEB&quot; in the Registry tab in SEB Config Tool, as SEB now remembers the settings which were active on the exam client computer before running SEB and resets them to the original values when exiting regularly. In case SEB would crash or the user would enforce a reset of the machine while SEB was running, these remembered values are used to restore the original Registry settings.</li>
  <li>Added a new command line tool SebRegistryResetter.exe which can be used to reset Registry values for the Windows Security Screen options in case the SEB Windows Service was damaged and can't be run anymore.<br />
    This tool can be found at the following directory path in your Program Files directory:<br />
    SafeExamBrowser\SebWindowsServiceWCF\SebRegistryResetter.exe<br />
    You need to execute this tool as administrator (right mouse button context menu option &quot;Run as administrator&quot;). In case the original values for the Registry Settings aren't found anymore, they will be reset to the Windows default values (all enabled). In this unlikely case you would also need to enter the user name of the user who was running SEB when resetting Registry values failed.</li>
  <li>SEB 2.0 RC5 now only needs the current .NET 4.5 framework (.NET 3.5 and 4.0 Full Profile don't need to be installed/activated anymore).</li>
  <li>Updated browser engine to XULRunner 28 (equivalent to Firefox 28).</li>
  <li>Changed the SEB profile directory to \Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\SafeExamBrowser\<br />
    Settings saved in the old profile directory in AppData\Local\ need to be moved manually or SEB reconfigured with a .seb settings file for configuring the client.</li>
  <li>Fixed bugs when dealing with permitted processes/third party applications and their paths. </li>
  <li>When &quot;allow user to select location of application&quot; is enabled for a permitted process, now only an executable with the same name as the one defined in settings is accepted. Empty executable names in settings are also ignored now.</li>
  <li>Improved closing of permitted processes: Now SEB first tries to close processes gracefully. This should solve the problem XULRunner wasn't closed properly especially on Windows 8.1 and failed to restart (profile in use). </li>
  <li>Fixed a bug when loading a .seb file &quot;for configuring a client&quot; and the SEB admin password has been set to empty before.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug when XULRunner didn't accept a quit password which was defined in the SEB Windows Config Tool.</li>
  <li>Fixed bugs in the SEB Config Tool, especially in the Permitted Processes tab. Deactivated some options which are not having any function in the current SEB version.</li>
  <li>SEB Config Tool now opens \Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\SafeExamBrowser\ as the default directory when opening or saving settings in the Config File pane.</li>
  <li>In the Appearance tab the main browser window size and position fields are deactivated when &quot;Use full screen mode&quot; is selected.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug in the SEB Config Tool Registry tab where the enable/disable check buttons didn't had any function.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug when switching between allowed applications in the SEB application chooser (Alt-Tab).</li>
  <li>Fixed bug when loading .seb file for configuring client and admin password was empty.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug which caused SEB Config Tool to crash because it tried to calculate a Browser Exam Key even though opening settings was canceled or loading the file failed.</li>
  <li>Browser Exam Key is now also calculated when reverting to default settings.</li>
  <li>All running applications are now minimized when SEB is started. This is useful when not using &quot;Create new desktop&quot; but &quot;Kill explorer shell&quot; (which is only recommended in managed environments and as a workaround when using third party software which isn't compatible with the &quot;create new desktop&quot; mode.</li>

<h5 id="sebh5">Release notes <a href="../download_en.html#Windows">Safe Exam Browser for Windows</a> version 2.0RC:</h5>
<p>Safe Exam Browser 2.0 is a completely re-engineered, modern .NET application, including new features, superior usability and improved stability.</p>
<p>Main features: </p>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li>Adds support for encrypted .seb setting files which allow to individually configure SEB per exam. The configuration is compatible with both the Windows and Mac version of SEB. Use the separate SEB Windows configuration tool to create .seb settings.</li>
  <li>Easier installation and initial configuration of a SEB client, which facilitates to use SEB for secure exams especially on unmanaged computers like students' own laptops, in BYOD scenarios.</li>
  <li>New feature to quit SEB after the exam is submitted by specifying a quit link and placing this on the summary page displayed by your LMS after submitting the exam.</li>
  <li>The Browser Exam Key allows an exam module to authenticate the connecting SEB version and its settings. For the learning management system Moodle a plug-in offering this functionality has been released, a plugin ILIAS will follow shortly (beta version available).</li>
  <li>New options in the user interface: Size and positioning of browser windows (main window with the quiz and additional browser windows) can be preset. The SEB main browser window can be displayed full screen or as a sizable and movable window.</li>
  <li>Permitted third party applications are easier to start up (autostart together with SEB and by clicking on its icon in the new SEB task bar). </li>
  <li>Prohibited processes and applications can be preset which are stopped when SEB starts up.</li>
  <li>PrintScreen can be blocked, the clipboard is cleaned when SEB is started and stopped. The Flash plugin is working again without workarounds.<br />
  </li>
  <li>SebWindowsConfig.exe - SEB configuration editor for creating and modifying .seb settings files for Safe Exam Browser 2.0:</li>
  <li>Allows to define all options for the Windows and Mac versions of SEB 2.0.</li>
  <li>Can save .seb files for individual configuration per exam and per exam client, which are protected by strong encryption against manipulation. </li>
  <li>Configuration files can configure a SEB exam client to show for example a portal page with the current exams.</li>
  <li>Configuration files can be used to start an exam with individual configuration (like specific security and user interface options, permitted third party applications, Browser Exam Key for authenticating these settings and the SEB application to an exam server, Quit Link to close SEB automatically when an exam is submitted etc.).</li>
  <li>Supports .seb files encrypted with password or X.509 (public/private key cryptography) certificates. For debugging purposes .seb configuration files can be saved unencrypted in an human readable XML format.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="sebh5">Release notes for <a href="../download_en.html#Windows">SEB Windows 1.9.1</a>:</h5>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li>New installation program:<br />
    Due to problems when installing or uninstalling SEB using the Windows installer (<em><strong>SebWindowsInstall.msi</strong></em>),   a new installer was created, which is <strong>more reliable and stable</strong> (e.g. Rollback in case there is a problem during the   installation).      
    The new installer has fewer input dialogs and is <strong>digitally signed</strong> using the certificate of the &quot;<strong>Verified Publisher</strong>&quot; ETH Zurich.</li>
  <li>Improved configuration program:<br />
    The graphical editor <em><strong>SebWindowsConfig.exe</strong></em> was reworked thoroughly and now offers better comfort and better look. After starting, the default configuration files <em>SebStarter.ini</em> and <em>MsgHook.ini</em> are <strong>automatically</strong> loaded into the editor. Different fonts for better   readability. Buttons for <strong>restoring</strong> loaded and accidentally modified   settings, for simultaneously saving both configuration files and for   quitting the editor. <strong>Security settings</strong> (e.g. for the Task Manager) can now be defined for <strong>inside and outside</strong> SEB. </li>
  <li><span class="half_linespace">New browser component:<br />
    with improved, updated XulRunner which can open additional browser windows now. <strong>Popup windows</strong> do not open in fullscreen mode but fill the screen only partially, with the option to <strong>minimise or maximise</strong> the window. File downloading should now work, too.</span></li>
  <li>Bugfix: When SEB was prematurely quit or crashed, the Windows Registry values (for the blue <em>Windows Security Screen</em>) remained <strong>changed</strong> (e.g. the Task Manager was disabled also in normal use). Now the user can during configuration define the values not only for <strong>inside</strong> but also for <strong>outside</strong> of SEB. If something goes wrong during SEB operation and the registry values are out of tune, you simply start SEB once again and quit it using the <strong>SEB exit sequence</strong> (e.g. F3_F11_F6). This will reset the registry values to the normal ones,<em><strong> </strong></em>and the Task Manager will be available again.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="sebh5">Release notes for <a href="../download_en.html#Windows">SEB Windows 1.8.2</a>:</h5>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li> Bugfix: Reloading / Refreshing the current page in the browser window by pressing the F5 key did not work. Now it is possible, provided that the F5 key is admitted. The new default setting for the F5 key is therefore &quot;enabled&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="sebh5">Release notes for <a href="../download_en.html#Windows">SEB Windows 1.8.1</a>:</h5>
<ul id="seblist"><li>
  Bugfix: Clicking on the SEB icon of the user's desktop in some cases launched the SEB installer rather than the actual SEB application. Now the SEB installer creates a shortcut to the SEB application on the <strong>common</strong> desktop. Thus the SEB icon and shortcut are visible to <strong>all</strong> users, and clicking on this icon launches the SEB application as intended.</li>
</ul>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li>Bugfix: When finishing, SEB restored the <strong>default</strong> registry values for Task Manager etc. (on the blue <em>Windows Security Screen</em>). Now, SEB instead restores the <strong>previous</strong> registry values (= the values before SEB was started).</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="sebh5"> Release notes for <a href="../download_en.html#Windows">SEB Windows 1.8</a>:</h5>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li>Easens configuration for the teacher.  It is now possible     to do the configuration in a new GUI editor called <em>SebWindowsConfig.exe</em> using mouse clicks, without directly editing the initialisation files <em>SebStarter.ini</em> and <em>MsgHook.ini</em>.</li>
</ul>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li>The file format of these ini files has been simplified and is now better human-readable.</li>
</ul>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li>In addition to the full version of SEB (installation via .msi file), a classic portable version can be built (copying of a zip file without installation), which has less functionality.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="sebh5"> Release notes for <a href="../download_en.html#Windows">SEB Windows 1.7</a>:</h5>
<ul id="seblist"><li>
  <p>Easens configuration and deployment for the teacher. It is now possible   to modify the configuration files before rather than after installation,   so the students can directly install SEB without patching it by   additional configuration files after installation. Also, an   Administrative Install via network is now possible. </p></li>
</ul>
<ul id="seblist">
  <li>Downloading a zip file, as in former SEB versions up to 1.4.1 </li>
</ul>
<h5 id="sebh5"> Release notes for <a href="../download_en.html#Windows">SEB Windows 1.6.1</a>:</h5>
