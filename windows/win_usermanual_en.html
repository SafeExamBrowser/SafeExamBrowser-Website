            Safe Exam Browser 3.x for Windows
          </h2>
    
          <p>Safe Exam Browser â€“ SEB for Windows opens a web browser window without navigation elements and locks the computer into a kiosk mode, which prevents from switching to other applications or quitting SEB untimely. <span class="half_linespace">SEB enables secure exams on unmanaged computers like students' own laptops as well as in managed environments</span>. Currently SEB integrates with the wide spread learning management systems (LMS) Moodle,  ILIAS and OpenOlat and several commercial and non-commercial exam systems, as for example Inspera Assessment. Generally it can easily be used with most  web-based online quiz and e-assessment systems. </p>
          <p>With version 3.x, the Safe Exam Browser underwent a comprehensive refactoring. SEB was recoded from scratch according to current standards. The basic functionality was retained. Some of the  changes are</p>
          <ul>
            <li>&nbsp;New embedded browser engine (Chromium)</li>
            <li>&nbsp;Dedicated builds for 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems</li>
            <li>&nbsp;Access to developer tools of browser engine (for web developers)</li>
            <li>&nbsp;Real-time access to SEB application log (e.g. to test features like the URL filter)</li>
            <li>&nbsp;Completely automated build system with unit tests</li>
            <li>&nbsp;SEB "Deeper Integration" features for Moodle 3.9 and later</li>

          </ul>

          <p>Please refer to the release notes for a comprehensive list of all features. The full range of functions of SEB 2.x is planned to be available gradually in upcoming versions.</p>
<p><strong>The following manual explains how to configure and use SEB for Windows from the perspective of exam administrators.</strong> SEB is a very flexible and modular tool, therefore documentation for examinees on how to use SEB with individual exam setups and the various exam systems it works with should be provided by the institution using SEB or their e-assessment provider.</p>

            <a class="anchorjs-link" href="#features"></a>
          Features of SEB </h3>
          
        <p>SEB disables the options of the <strong>Windows Security Screen</strong> (invoked by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del), namely <strong>Lock (this Computer)</strong>, <strong>Switch User</strong>, <strong>Sign out (Log off</strong>), <strong>Change a password</strong>, <strong>(Start) Task Manager</strong>, <strong>Shut down, Restart </strong>and <strong>Ease of Access</strong>. It disables the <strong>Windows Task Bar</strong> and the <strong>Start Menu</strong> (button in the lower left corner of the screen), the <strong>App/Task/Window Switcher</strong> (invoked by Alt-Tab and Windows-Tab), as well as printing.  It can also be set whether  users can quit SEB and if it is required to enter a quit password to do so.</p>
        
        <p>Its possible to configure SEB  to quit after the exam is submitted without having to enter a quit password by specifying a <span class="quote">quit link</span> and placing this on the summary page displayed by the LMS after submitting the exam.</p>
        
        <p>In the browser window there is no right mouse (or Shift-F10) click popup window available. </p>
        
        <p>SEB detects when it was started in a virtual instead of a native environment and refuses to run, if not explicitly allowed to. This virtual machine detection helps avoiding manipulation of the exam environment when SEB is used in unmanaged environments.</p>
        
        <p>SEB for Windows is now based on the Chromium Embedded Framework<b><i>&nbsp;CEF </i></b>(in contrast to the  <em><strong>WebKit</strong></em> browser engine used by SEB for macOS, which is also used by Safari and some open source browsers). </p>
        
        <p> SEB for Windows can be used together with additional (third party) applications during an exam. You can download and open files linked in your online exam, edit it in a third party application and then upload the results to your online quiz/LMS again. </p>
        <p>SEB uses encrypted <span class="quote">.seb</span> setting files which allow to individually configure SEB per exam. Also see the <a href="../presentations/HowTo_SEB2.0.pdf" target="_blank">how to use SEB 2.0 document</a> explaining the concept behind SEB.</p>
        <p>SEB allows to manage exam startup and SEB configuration in many ways, so a wide area of scenarios is supported, depending on your specific needs.</p>
<p><strong><span class="red">Please understand that you also have to configure your exam system correctly to be locked down securely.</span></strong> SEB is generally  locking down exam client computers only, not the exam system or the quiz module of a learning management system. <strong>Check documentation for your exam/learning management system on how to lock it down correctly.</strong></p>

            Using SEB  with Supported LMS
          </h3>
          
          <p>Some learning management systems require plugins to be installed to fully support secure exams taken with SEB, others have built-in support.</p>

            Using SEB  with Moodle</strong>
          </h4>
          
          <p> SEB support in Moodle has the following objectives:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Don't display any links during an exam which would allow to navigate to other sections of Moodle or even other websites. This means the course navigation, link to the user's Moodle profile, logout, link to the University homepage etc. needs to be disabled/hidden. Only the quiz navigation (to navigate to other questions) and the &quot;Finish attempt...&quot; link  should be visible </li>
            <li>Make sure a quiz can only be taken using Safe Exam Browser, display an error message if trying to open the quiz in another web browser. </li>
            <li>Check if   legitimate SEB settings or optionally if the correct version of SEB are used.</li>
          </ol>
		
          <p><strong>Since Moodle 3.9, there is support for Safe Exam Browser configuration directly available in Moodle's quiz settings.</strong> The new &quot;deeper integration&quot; is <a href="https://moodle.org/plugins/quizaccess_seb" target="_blank">also available as plugin for Moodle 3.7 and 3.8</a>. If possible, use this new SEB support in Moodle. Refer to the <a href="https://docs.moodle.org/39/en/Safe_Exam_Browser" target="_blank">official Moodle documentation</a> for details. Please note that our SEB support cannot answer specific Moodle  questions, use the <a href="https://docs.moodle.org/39/en/Main_page" target="_blank">documentation on moodle.org</a> and the <a href="https://moodle.org/course/" target="_blank">Moodle community forums</a>.</p>
          <p>See below the two older options how to activate SEB support in Moodle, which are  no longer available  (or don't make sense) in current Moodle versions:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Enable the &quot;classic&quot;  SEB support in Moodle: <a href="https://docs.moodle.org/28/en/Safe_exam_browser" target="_blank">How to activate the SEB secure browser mode in a Moodle quiz</a>. Then configure the quiz at <span class="quote">Administration / Quiz administration / Edit settings / Extra restrictions on attempts / Browser security / Require the use of Safe Exam Browser</span>. This option uses only a basic, not very secure check for the used browser. This may be safe enough if students can only access the exam from centrally managed university computers inside a computer lab/exam room. For other scenarios like BYOD you should use the second option.</li>
            <li>Use the <span class="quote"> Browser Exam Key</span> authentication in Moodle for the connecting SEB version and its settings by installing the <a href="https://github.com/moodleou/moodle-quizaccess_safeexambrowser" target="_blank">quiz access rule plugin</a> in Moodle. In addition you will have to copy the Browser Exam Key hash code string into the quiz settings (<span class="quote">Administration / Quiz administration / Edit settings / Extra restrictions on attempts / Allowed browser keys</span>). This key is generated by SEB when you save the settings you intend to use for the exam. As this key includes a hash (checksum) of both the saved exam settings and the code signature of the used SEB version, you may have to generate and copy several Browser Exam Keys into the Moodle quiz settings, for example one for the Windows version of SEB and one for the Mac version. As an alternative, you may use the <strong>Config Key </strong>instead of the Browser Exam key. Basically, the Config Key works like the Brwoser Exam Key, but without including the SEB version string in the hash key. This way you would at best only have to copy one key to your Moodle settings, even if you are using different versions of SEB (e.g. Mac/Windows).</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>Sometimes hiding of the course navigation, link to the user's Moodle profile, logout etc. doesn't work as expected because <span class="red">some custom Moodle themes don't support the secure browser mode of Moodle correctly, they display links with which students can get out of the quiz during an exam.</span> If this happens only with your customized theme and not the standard Moodle theme, then your theme is not implemented correctly. In that case you should fix the problem in your custom Moodle theme.  You may also create URL filter rules in the SEB configuration to only allow access to the exam and no other parts of Moodle, but this is not trivial and we cannot provide you with any support on that. </p>
          <p>You may find additional information and help in the discussion boards for <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/seb/discussion/" target="_blank">SEB</a> and <a href="https://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=737" target="_blank">Moodle</a>.</p>

            Using SEB  with ILIAS
          </h4>
          
          <p>You can find information about how to install the ILIAS plugin for SEB support <a href="https://github.com/hrz-unimr/Ilias.SEBPlugin" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
          
          <p>Please note that currently  support for Safe Exam Browser in ILAS can only be switched on for some roles of a whole installation, not a single exam/course.</p>
          
          <h4 class="seb-section-header sebnavbar-link" id="OpenOlat">
            <a class="anchorjs-link" href="#OpenOlat"></a>
            Using SEB  with OpenOlat
          </h4>
          
          <p>An assessment mode has been added to the OpenOlat standard with the 10.2 release. The assessment mode allows course authors to limit the functionality and access of OpenOlat courses for exam settings. An exam setting is not limited to online tests however, IMS QTI 2.1 assessments, SCORM modules, external LTI 1.1 or 1.3 tools and all other OpenOlat course elements can be configured for such an exam setting.</p>
          
          <p>One of the many security features is the enforced usage of  Safe Exam Browser. An exam setting can be configured with multiple <a href="win_usermanual_en.html#ExamPane">Browser Exam Key</a> keys. As of version 16.2, OpenOlat alternatively supports configuring SEB natively within OpenOlat using the <a href="https://safeexambrowser.org/developer/seb-config-key.html">Config Key</a> mechanism, which greatly simplifies the SEB configuration and usage both for administrators and users.</p>
          
			<p>When launching a protected assessment, users are directly prompted with the config file and SEB download if not already installed. The quit-link feature is also fully integrated in the user experience enabled by a single click by the author. When using the lecture and absence management module, teachers can convert regular lectures into SEB protected assessments with a single click.</p>
			
          <p>No additional software needs to be installed in order to use the assessment mode together with  Safe Exam Browser. The module is fully integrated ready to use in every OpenOlat installation. The assessment mode is globally enabled / disabled in Administration -&gt; Modules -&gt; Assessment mode. Within the courses the configuration is done in the course menu.</p>

            Download/Installation
          </h3>
          
          <p>You can download the setup program of SEB for Windows (also containing the SEB Windows configuration tool) <a href="../download_en.html#Windows">on our download page</a>. Just start <span class="path">SEB_xxx_SetupBundle.exe</span> and follow the steps of the installation program. If you require an MSI package for installing SEB using a deployment system, then you can find them alongside the setup bundle on our offical download mirrors (see link above). <span class="red"><strong>IMPORTANT: Please note that you'll have to manually install the required runtime dependencies when using the MSI packages!</strong></span></p>
          <p>SEB for Windows containing the main application executable <span class="path">SafeExamBrowser.exe</span> and the configuration tool <span class="path">SebWindowsConfig.exe</span> are placed in the SEB application folder named <span class="path">SafeExamBrowser</span> which will be installed into the standard program folder of your computer (usually <span class="path">C:\Program Files</span> or <span class="path">C:\Program Files (x86)</span>, depending on whether you have a 32-bit or 64-bit machine). Also a <span class="path">Safe Exam Browser</span> program  entry will be placed into your Start Menu.</p>
          <p><strong>Updating:</strong> In most cases you can just run the installer of the new SEB version and it will automatically update from the previous to the new version. The client configuration (see below) will not be removed or replaced, as it is compatible with any new SEB version. If you were using a significantly older SEB version (2.1.x, especially 2.1 or older) or the older SEB installation got corrupted, you should uninstall the old SEB version using the <em>Windows Control Panel</em>(or likewise <em>Settiings - Apps &amp; features</em>). As the <em>Windows Installer</em> usually leaves some files behind, you should afterwards delete the SEB application directory in <span class="path">C:\Program Files (x86)</span>\ manually <strong>(IMPORTANT: Always FIRST UNINSTALL, then delete)</strong>.  Then install the new SEB version.</p>
          <p><strong>Uninstalling:</strong> Use the <em>Windows Control Panel</em> (or likewise Settings - Apps &amp; features) to uninstall SEB. As the <em>Windows Installer</em> usually leaves some files behind, you can delete the SEB application directory in <span class="path">C:\Program Files (x86)</span>\ manually <strong>(IMPORTANT: Always FIRST UNINSTALL, then delete)</strong>. If uninstalling using the <em>Windows Control Panel</em> doesn't work, then you can try to use the installer of the exact same SEB version you had installed (<a href="../support_en.html">contact us</a> if you don't have that installer version anymore and it's no longer available for download). Just start it and select the remove/uninstall option. If this still doesn't work, then your Windows system got corrupted. SEB is using the standard <em>Windows Installer</em> procedures for installing and uninstalling and those can fail in some cases, which is not connected to SEB itself. You can also remove the directories <span class="path">C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\SafeExamBrowser\</span> (path using Windows path variables: <span class="path">%APPDATA%\SafeExamBrowser\</span>) and <span class="path">C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\SafeExamBrowser\</span> (path using Windows path variables: <span class="path">%LocalAppData%\SafeExamBrowser\</span>), where the client configuration file, temporary files, log data and browser session data files are saved.

          Starting and Quitting SEB </h3>
          
          <p>When you start SEB, all currently running applications, the Windows Task Bar and the desktop are hidden. On the main screen SEB opens its web browser window filling the whole screen (optionally the browser window can be resized and moved or switched to fullscreen). SEB opens the webpage at the preset Start URL, which might take some seconds. As default, as long as you don't set another <span class="quote">Start URL</span> (see <a href="#configuration">Configuration</a>), SEB for Windows opens <a href="https://safeexambrowser.org/start/" target="_blank">this page</a> with initial instructions. </p>
          <p>SEB by default doesn't allow the navigation buttons, but they may be enabled via the configuration. The optional reload button in the SEB taskbar, the browser toolbar (if activated) or the key <strong>F5</strong> can be used to reload the current page.</p>
          
          <p>To quit SEB (while it's using the default settings), just press the <span class="quote">Quit</span> button in the SEB taskbar or key combination <span class="quote">Ctrl+Q</span>. Quitting SEB can optionally be switched off or password protected. When SEB quits, the applications which were running before starting it will get unhidden again (as long as settings didn't force to quit those applications).</p>

          Configuration of SEB </h3>
        
          <p>SEB for Windows comes with a configuration tool which should be used for configuring SEB. You can find the <span class="path">SEBConfigTool.exe </span>in the Windows start menu or in the SEB application folder <span class="path">SafeExamBrowser</span>, which is placed in the standard program folder of your computer (usually <span class="path">C:\Program Files</span> or <span class="path">C:\Program Files (x86)</span>, depending on whether you have a 32-bit or 64-bit machine). </p>
          
          <p>In the SEB configuration<em><strong></strong></em> tool window, settings are grouped in several panes. There you can set  the parameters described below.</p>
          
          <ul id="seblist">
            <li>In the <span class="quote">General</span> pane you'll find  basic settings like the URL which SEB opens at startup and the passwords to  open a config file for editing and to quit/restart SEB. When first time using SEB, you might only have to change these general settings, as the default values for all other settings should reflect the more &quot;secure&quot; option.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Config File</span> contains details about encryption of the SEB <span class="quote">.seb</span> configuration files plus all functions to deal with opening, saving, reverting, duplicating and applying settings. These commands can also be accessed in the menu bar above the tab bar. </li>
            <li><span class="quote">User Interface</span> contains general SEB user interface settings; </li>
            <li><span class="quote">Browser</span> all detail settings for the built-in SEB web browser. </li>

Otherwise you can shutdown or reboot the computer. In a computer room in a university or school you could for example use some tool to shutdown or reboot all computers after a exam and therefore not allow students to quit SEB themselves at all. <strong>This setting has no influence on a Quit Link</strong> (if one is set, see <a href="win_usermanual_en.html#ExamPane">Exam Pane</a>).</li>

If no quit password is set, then SEB just prompts &quot;Are you sure you want to quit SEB?&quot;. The password is not prompted when using a <strong>Quit Link</strong>.<br />
            This password is also prompted if the <span class="quote">restart exam button</span> is used (if activated and configured to be password protected, see <a href="win_usermanual_en.html#ExamPane">Exam Pane</a>). </li>

If such a file exists in this location, this will be read by SEB with first priority and another file at the <span class="quote">Local Application Data</span> folder of the current user will be ignored. As the PROGRAMDATA directory usually is writable only with administrator rights, regular users cannot change the exam computer's default settings, which is the desired case on a managed computer. <br>
              <strong>You should only use a client settings file<span class="path">SebClientSettings.seb</span> in the <span class="path">\ProgramData\SafeExamBrowser\</span> directory on deployed exam client machines, not on your admin workstation, as SEB will ignore all local client settings which you configure in the Config Tool </strong>(&quot;Use Current Settings to Configure Client&quot;, &quot;Revert Settings to Local Client Settings&quot; and  &quot;Apply and Restart SEB&quot; won't work as expected,  see also below)<strong>!</strong></p>

Install that identity on your SEB clients, then they can decrypt <span class="quote">.seb</span> files encrypted with this certificate/key. You can also make identities available to specific computers in a network zone over the LAN without placing them physically onto the exam clients (ask your Windows network administrators about that). You can install identities on client computers using deployment systems or by embedding them into a <span class="quote">.seb</span> config file for configuring the client (see <a href="win_usermanual_en.html#NetworkPaneCertificatesSection">Network / Certificates</a> pane). <strong>If the identity certificates are installed into Local Machine/Trusted People, then they are available for all users on that machine</strong> (as Windows makes them available for all users in their Current User/Trusted People stores).</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Use old asymmetric-only encryption (for SEB &lt; 2.2)</span>: Starting in SEB 2.2,  a new encryption method for identity-encrypted config files can be used, which can decrypt large settings much faster. This is especially important if you embed large additional resources into config files. But if you need to save config files compatible to earlier SEB versions  (before 2.2, also current macOS versions of SEB) then you should use this setting.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Settings password</span>: Password to decrypt the settings file, if one is set then it will be prompted when SEB reads the settings. <span class="red"><strong>Local client settings</strong></span><strong> (saved on every exam client, at one of the two possible standard paths, see above) <span class="red">should be saved with the option &quot;Use SEB settings file for ... configuring a client&quot;, so you (and examinees when starting SEB) don't have to enter any settings password</span>.</strong> Then a standard password is used for encrypting these settings. This is not very safe, but you should anyways not store any really secret information (like critical admin and quit passwords or a secret exam URL) in the local client settings, for that you should use  separate settings files saved with the option <span class="quote">&quot;Use SEB settings file for ... starting an exam</span>&quot;.</li>

          <span class="quote">Browser view mode</span>
<ul>
          <li><span class="quote">Use browser window</span>: Use a window for the SEB browser which can be scaled and moved around, also to another screen when available. One advantage of using a browser window is that if you're using a large wide screen display, some web pages may not be ergonomic to read. With the scalable browser window you can adjust the width of displayed web pages.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul id="seblist">
            <li><span class="quote">Use full screen mode</span>: Display the SEB browser full screen. Full screen browser mode should mainly be used with exam systems which display everything in one main window and don't open auxiliary windows: When a web page opens in a new window, this will be hidden behind the full screen main browser window when the user clicks into that. From SEB 2.1 you can access single windows in the SEB taskbar (click on the SEB icon) or with Alt-Tab.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Touch optimized</span>: Enables the touch optimized mode for Windows tablet computers (for Windows 8.1 and 10). <strong>In current versions of Windows 10 you need to enable the Windows 10 &quot;Tablet Mode&quot; as well before starting SEB in touch optimized mode</strong>. Select theÂ <strong>Action Center</strong>Â icon on the Windows taskbar (next to the date and time), and then selectÂ <strong>Tablet mode</strong>Â to turn it on. The Windows on-screen keyboard is not working with the Create New Desktop kiosk mode, that's why you have to use the Disable Explorer Shell kiosk mode.
              <br>
              <br>
Touch optimized mode features are:
<ul id="seblist">
              <li> Larger buttons in the SEB taskbar</li>
              <li>Touch optimized message boxes (alerts, dialogs) with larger buttons</li>
              <li>The Windows on-screen keyboard is displayed when the user touches a text field on a browser page or when SEB asks to enter a password. If a physical keyboard is connected, SEB doesn't show the on-screen keyboard.</li>
              <li> New web pages open in full screen 'windows', switch between open pages with the open windows chooser popup menu invoked by tapping the SEB icon in the SEB taskbar. With the close button below each window in this window chooser you can close open browser full screen 'windows'.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

          <span class="quote">Main browser window size and position</span>
          <ul>
            <li>You can set the <span class="quote">width</span> and <span class="quote">height </span>of the main SEB browser window as absolute pixel values or a percentage of the screen width or height.  You can enter the dimensions (in pixels or percent values) in the text field or select one of the predefined values in the   pop down menu. </li>
            <li><span class="quote">Horizontal positioning</span>:  You can choose how the window will be positioned horizontally if it doesn't fill the full screen width: Left, Center, Right.</li>
          </ul>
          <span class="quote">Browser Window Toolbar</span>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="quote">Enable browser window toolbar</span>: Indicates if a toolbar is displayed on top of the browser window, a browser menu at the right end, and a reload button at the left end of the toolbar. The browser menu entries can be configured using the respective options in this pane (<span class="quote">Enable zoom (Win/Mac)</span>, <span class="quote">Show developer tools in window menu (Win)</span>) or on the Browser pane (<span class="quote">Allow text search</span>) .You can also configure the toolbar to show back/forward buttons by enabling navigation in the Browser pane. <br />Note that the browser toolbar will also be displayed when <span class="quote">Show reload button</span> is activated, since the reload button was moved from the taskbar to the browser toolbar (so both options essentially do the same thing now).<br />
				The following options can be used to fine tune the browser toolbar:
				<ul>
					<li> <span class="quote">Allow adress bar for main window (Win)</span>: Displays the browser's adress field in the main window. This field, if displayed, is editable!
					</li>
					<li> <span class="quote">Allow adress bar for additional windows (Win)</span>: Displays the browser's adress field in additional browser windows (these can be allowed on the Browser pane). This field, if displayed, is editable!
					</li>
					<li> <span class="quote">Show developer tools in window menu (Win)</span>: Allows access to the web developer tools of the integrated browser engine (via the browser window menu).
					</li>
					<li> <span class="quote">Hide toolbar as default (Mac)</span>:  After SEB starts, the browser window toolbar is hidden. Users can unhide the toolbar in the view menu or the contextual menu on the browser window title bar.
					</li>
				</ul>
            </li>
            <li><span class="quote">Show menu bar (Mac)</span>: The menu bar can be used in SEB for macOS to access menu bar widgets like changing keyboard layouts, re-connecting to a WiFi network etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <span class="quote">Taskbar / Dock / Side Menu</span>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="quote">Show taskbar / dock</span>: Usually to be used when you permit third party applications, which are displayed as icons. Clicking on the icon of an application starts it (if it wasn't running yet), brings the application to foreground or maximizes its window if it was minimized before. The taskbar is not required, users can also switch to third party applications using the task switcher with keys Alt-Tab. But if users quit a third party application,  they can restart it only by using its taskbar icon (or by opening a file which is linked in an exam and gets opened by that application).
             <li><span class="quote">Show side menu</span>: The side menu, if enabled, appears on the lefthand side of the desktop when WINDOWS-key + A is pressed (the same key combination for the Action Center of Windows). Pressing those keys again will hide the side menu. In the side menu, all options and information from the SEB taskbar are presented again. If you need maximum vertical space for your browser window, you can disable the SEB taskbar completly, relying on the side menu alone showing up only when needed. </li>
             <li><span class="quote">Show Wi-Fi control</span>: Allows to reconnect to Wi-Fi networks which have previously been connected to.</li>
             <li><span class="quote">Show reload button</span>: This button in the SEB taskbar reloads the current web page. Shows warning if so enabled in Browser settings tab. Note that the browser toolbar will also be displayed when this option is activated, even if option <span class="quote">Enable browser window toolbar</span> is disabled. </li>
             <li><span class="quote">Show time</span>: Displays current time in SEB taskbar: This is for example helpful if you decide to ban personal watches in exams (because of smartwatches).</li>
             <li><span class="quote">Show keyboard layout</span>: Shows current keyboard layout and allows to switch to other keyboard layouts which have been enabled in Windows.</li>
	</ul>
     <span class="quote">Enable zoom (Win/Mac)</span>
	<ul>
            <li><span class="quote">Enable page zoom</span>:he internal SEB browser can be zoomed with cmd +/- or the commands in the view menu and buttons in browser window toolbar (Mac). Additionally, third party applications can also be zoomed with Ctrl-Mousewheel (Win).</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Enable text zoom</span>: Text in browser windows can be zoomed with Ctrl-Mousewheel (Win) or ctrl - cmd +/- or the commands in the view menu and buttons in browser window toolbar (Mac)</li>
          </ul>
          <span class="quote">Audio Controls</span>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="quote">Show audio controls</span>: Show the audio control icon in the SEB taskbar which can be used to mute or change audio volume.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Mute audio on startup</span>: Mute  audio initially (when starting SEB or an exam).</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Set initial audio volume</span>: Set an initial value for the audio volume.</li>

          <span class="quote">Spell Checker </span>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="quote">Allow spell checking</span>: Spell checking in the SEB browser underlines incorrectly spelled words and displays word suggestions (right mouse button needs to be enabled in Hooked Keys tab). </li>
            <li><span class="quote">Allow dictionary look up</span> (Mac): Allow looking up text elements on a web site using the 3-finger tap on a trackpad or ctrl-cmd-D</li>

          <ul>
            <li><span class="quote">Allow text search</span>: Enables the search feature in the browser menu, located in the browser toolbar. This feature needs the browser toolbar to be enabled. </li>

	<p  class="quote">Restriction in Exam Windows / Restriction in Additional Windows</p>
			  <ul>
            <li><span class="quote">Allow navigating back/forward in exam</span>: Disabling browsing to previously visited pages (by Ctrl-Cursor left) increases security, because it might be possible to leave an exam by browsing back to an external start page.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Allow navigating in additional windows</span>: Disabling browsing to previously visited pages (by Ctrl-Cursor left) might not be desired for additional resources and other content opening in additional browser windows, therefore this separate setting.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Allow reload in exam</span>: You can disable reload completely (reload button in taskbar, browser tool bar, iOS side slider menu, keyboard shortcut F5/cmd+R) with this setting, as  offline caching in some e-assessment systems might break when the user tries to reload a page without internet connection.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Allow reload in additional windows</span>:  For additional resources and other content opening in additional browser windows reload can be enabled/disabled separately with this setting.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Show reload warning</span>: SEB shows a warning asking the user to confirm reloading the main browser containing the exam.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Show reload warning in additional windows</span>: You can disable/enable the reload warning for additional resources and other content opening in additional browser windows separately.</li>
            <li><font color="#666666"><b>Show URL's</b></font>: This setting controls if or how the URL of your exam web page is displayed in the browser's windows title.

             <li><span class="quote">User agent (Mac)</span>: Allows to switch between the default and a custom browser user agent string in SEB for macOS running in  desktop mode. The default string depends on the installed Safari/WebKit version and therefore can differ on exam clients. SEB for macOS also appends its version number automatically to the selected user agent string.</li>

			  <li><span class="quote">User agent for touch/tablet mode</span>: Allows to switch between the default, an iPad-like and a custom browser user agent string for SEB Windows running in  the touch optimized mode (on tablet computers).

            <li><span class="quote">Choose download / upload directory</span>: Choose the download directory with this button, which displays a file/directory chooser dialog. In the  path displayed afterwards righthand of the button, SEB automatically replaces sections with a Windows environment variable, so paths are portable to other computers, for instance with another user account name (if you for example select your <span class="path">Documents</span> folder, the path becomes <span class="path">%USERPROFILE%\Documents</span>). An empty path means SEB uses the user's default <span class="path">Download</span> folder.</li>

            <li><span class="quote">Choose file to uploadâ€¦</span>  (Mac only): SEB can let the user choose the file to upload manually (as usual) or automatically choose the same file which was downloaded before. There are three possible policies to choose the file to upload:</li>

            <li><span class="quote">by only allowing to upload the same file downloaded before</span>: 
              If the file is not found,  an error message is presented. This setting might bring additional security, because only files which have been downloaded before (in the same browser session, means since SEB was started) can be uploaded. If several files have been downloaded, pressing the <span class="quote">choose file</span> (or similarly named) button  in the browser window will first choose the file most recently downloaded, pressing the button several times will cycle through all the files downloaded in this session.<br />
            </ul>
            <li><span class="quote">Download and open PDF files instead of displaying them inline</span>: PDF files will not be displayed by SEB but downloaded and opened  (usually Preview or Adobe Acrobat). This option is useful when you <span class="quote">allow to switch to third party applications</span> and e.g. want to use some PDF forms which have to be filled out by  the examinees/users.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Allow using Acrobat Reader PDF plugin (insecure! Mac only)</span>: The Adobe Acrobat Reader browser plugin should only be used on secured managed Mac computers, as it allows to access the file system and  cloud services.</li>

            Settings in the Applications Pane
          </h4>
          <p>You can allow third party applications to be used while SEB is running. Usually you would enable the SEB taskbar, then for each allowed application (with the setting &quot;Icon in taskbar&quot; enabled) an application icon will be displayed in the SEB taskbar. Clicking on the icon  starts the application when it's not yet running or brings its window(s) to the foreground. If a running application has several windows open, SEB displays a window chooser. You can switch between open windows with  keys Alt-Tab as well.</p>
          <p>SEB allows only applications to run which are configured in &quot;Permitted Processes&quot; (as long as the &quot;Monitor processes&quot; setting above is active). But SEB cannot prevent these applications from:</p>
          <p><strong>â€¢ Accessing the file system (local or network drives).</strong> So if you use an application which can open and save files and displays a file dialog, students can access local and network drives on the exam computer. </p>
          <p><strong>â€¢ Accessing the internet.</strong> SEB only has a URL filter for the built-in browser, other applications and the system are not blocked from accessing the internet. So any third party software with a built-in help browser or similar can be used to cheat during an exam.</p>
          <p>Therefore using such applications requires additional measures, as for example a  drive which is cleaned before every exam on a managed computer and a firewall (either hardware or firewall filter rules in a virtual desktop, see below). If you intend to use SEB with third party applications on unmanaged computers (BYOD, student owned machines), you should run the exam including those third party applications in a secured virtual machine, usually this would be a virtual desktop. <a href="http://safeexambrowser.org/vdi/Competence-Oriented_Exams_VDI+SEB_ETH-LET_2017_03.pdf" target="_blank">This technical paper</a> describes the virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) environment <a href="https://www.ethz.ch/en.html" target="_blank">ETH Zurich</a> (the top ranked  university in continental Europe which is the driving force behind the development of SafeExamBrowser) is using for such exams. For other (less technical) papers on our exam environment, see our <a href="../about_publications_en.html">publications</a> page. Our environment runs on managed computers and uses the VMware View Client software secured by SEB on the local machine and another instance of SEB running inside the virtual desktop, allowing to use the configured permitted third party applications in addition to an exam displayed by the SEB browser. In a bring-your-own-device scenario you would ideally use VDI with a technology like <a href="https://www.vmware.com/pdf/horizon-view/horizon-html-access-4x-document.pdf" target="_blank">VMware Horizon View HTML Access</a>. Then students just need to install/run SEB on their Windows or Mac laptops. SEB would be configured to only load and display the HTML Access portal page in a full screen browser window (ideally without displaying the SEB taskbar/dock). The entire exam takes place in the virtual desktop, which can be perfectly secured. You also don't have to worry about distributing, configuring and licensing those third party applications you want to use in exams to students, as you just have to install and configure these applications once on the master image for the VDI exam pool. If an exam computer breaks down during the exam, no data is lost, as everything is running inside the virtual desktop on your server infrastructure. Usually such exams would have a browser-based part, where you place the questions and maybe template files, which students then can open in the permitted third party applications. After they finish working on those documents, they can save the results and upload them into the exam, using a file upload question type. Students can only interact with the empty file system inside the virtual desktop, they also cannot access the local file systems or connected USB sticks on their BYOD exam computers.</p>

            <li><span class="quote">Path</span>: Optional filesystem path (formatted system specific) to the process executable's directory <strong>excluding the filename, see field executable</strong>. If the path is not given or relative, then SEB searches the system provided paths for applications. For applications which have been installed and properly registered in Windows  App Paths you don't need to specify the path. If the executable for an application is placed in a subdirectory of the path registered in Windows App Paths, then you usually can indicate just the relative path. SEB also is able to&nbsp;expand  environment variables in path of permitted processes. This allows to configure applications to run as permitted process, which need to be installed in subdirectories of the user directory, for example %AppData%.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Arguments</span>  to append to the executable  of the application when starting it. You can select if an argument is <span class="quote">active</span> or not (for testing). You can add and remove arguments using the <span class="quote">+/-</span> buttons.</li>

            <li><span class="quote">Allow running in background</span>: Permitted processes with this option set are allowed to already be running when starting SEB. In this case SEB doesn't ask the user if the process can be terminated before continuing to start SEB. Processes with the option &quot;Allow running in background&quot; don't have an icon in the SEB taskbar. They can nevertheless have the option &quot;Autostart&quot; set, in this case SEB attempts to start the permitted process regardless if it was already running or not (and the option &quot;Icon in taskbar&quot; is considered in this case). <br />
            <strong>      If you need some background process running together with SEB and this process might display some window or alert/message box, you have to add this process's executable to permitted processes with the option &quot;Allow running in background&quot; set, otherwise SEB will hide the window of the background process when &quot;Monitor processes&quot; is selected (or even terminate that process, in case it cannot be hidden).</strong></li>

      Disabling this setting  does not mean that processes are not killed: Depending on the platform's capabilities, SEB first tries to terminate prohibited processes and applications nicely or asking the user to do it themselves, if this doesn't work then it terminates them anyways (as long as <em>monitor processes</em> is enabled). But enabling <em>Force quit</em> will speed up this process.<br />
      This flag should not be set for macOS applications which allow to be terminated nicely (they are anyways automatically terminated, without asking the user).</li>

          <p>Java applications (like OpenOffice) can  be used as permitted processes, but require specific settings: The title of their main window must be defined in  the field <span class="quote">Permitted Processes -&gt; Identifier</span> (for example &quot;OpenOffice Calc&quot;), the required main executable in <span class="quote">Permitted Processes -&gt; Executable</span> (&quot;scalc.exe&quot;) and the process which is actually handling the main window in <span class="quote">Permitted Processes -&gt; Window Handling Process(es)</span> (&quot;soffice.bin&quot;). For this example the executable path should be entered as &quot;program&quot; in <span class="quote">Permitted Processes -&gt; Path</span>, as that is the relative path to the main executable from the OpenOffice main directory, which is registered in Windows <span class="quote">App Paths</span>.</p>

            Prohibited Processes Section
          </h5>
    
          <p>List of processes which are prohibited to run during an exam.  With the prohibited processes list, you can prevent some specific  applications and background processes from running together with SEB. Don't use this  on system processes or only with care (test if the system continues to run safely when the prohibited processes are killed by SEB). SEB will always ask the user first to quit the applications in the prohibited processes list manually when starting up or before starting an exam using an SEB link (if exam settings contain different prohibited processes than SEB client settings and SEB was started directly, not by opening a SEB link from another browser). </p>
          <p><strong>Since SEB 2.1.7, some default processes are blocked by SEB automatically, as they could be used for cheating and should not be running during exams.</strong> These default prohibited processes are added automatically to any SEB settings both when editing these settings in the SEB Config Tool and when starting the SEB client. They cannot be removed from  the prohibited processes list (if you try, the SEB client will automatically add them again). But you can deactivate SEB checking for them by unchecking the &quot;Active&quot; checkbox for that prohibited process in your SEB settings. So if you change  parameters like &quot;Active&quot; for such processes, SEB will use your preference. </p>
          <p>For processes for which it doesn't matter if they are terminated by SEB (like  applications implementing proper autosave or if they don't contain any user inputed data which might be lost if they are terminated), you can set the parameter  &quot;Force quit&quot;. Then SEB doesn't ask the user to quit the process, but just terminates it silently.</p>
          <p>It might be an inconvenience having to quit running applications before starting an exam, but this is the only possible way for SEB to prevent that some specific applications could be used for cheating. <strong>The safest exam environment would be if students would quit ALL applications before the exam.</strong></p>

Also you can generate code signatures here. <strong>Not yet available in SEB 2.0.</strong></li>-->

          <p>While most of the features of SEB 2 have been migrated to SEB 3, the &quot;Additional Ressources&quot; feature still was not migrated due to high priority of other new features (SEB server integration).

          <ul id="seblist">
            <li><span class="quote">Activate URL filtering</span>: Filter URLs when loading web pages using the filter set defined below and in additional resources.<br />
            </li>
            <li> <span class="quote">Filter also embedded content</span>: If selected, also all embedded resources will be filtered using the filter set.    Note that there can be hundreds of resources such as images and other media per page, so filtering all content may slow down page loading.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The table contains  URL filter rules, consisting of an <span class="quote">allow</span> or <span class="quote">block</span> action. The URL filter always first processes rules with the block action, if one matches, then the according http request is discarded. If no block rule matched, then rules with an allow action are processed. If one matches, then the request is loaded. If no allow rule matched, then the request is discarded.<br />
          Discarding a http request means that a link with the URL is not followed and the user is notified with an alert. When content filtering is enabled, an embedded resource with the according URL is not loaded, in this case there's no notification about that, but it is written to the log. Create a new rule  by clicking the<span class="codetext">'+'</span> button below the table. Remove a rule by selecting it in the table and clicking the <span class="codetext">'-'</span> button.</p>
          
          <p>SEB automatically creates an allow filter rule for the exact address of the <span class="quote">Start URL</span> defined in these settings. This means that if your <span class="quote">Start URL</span> is <span class="path">example.com</span>, then all pages and resources in the domain example.com  will be allowed. If your <span class="quote">Start URL</span> is <span class="path">example.com/exams/engineering2015-1.html</span>, then only the pages with this exact address will be allowed. In this case you have to manually add an allow filter rule so all pages and resources your exam uses will be allowed (like <span class="path">example.com/exams/*</span>).</p>
          <p><strong>If you defined URL filter rules in SEB 2.1.x for Windows, then you'll have to re-enter those in the current SEB Config Tool (SEB for Windows &gt;= 2.2), following the new filter rule scheme.</strong> URL filter rules created and saved with SEB for macOS are already compatible with SEB &gt;= 2.2 for Windows.</p>
          
          <p class="seb-section-header quote">Rules</p>
          
          <ul id="seblist">
            <li><span class="quote">Active</span>:
              Indicates if the rule is active.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Regex</span>:
              Indicates if the  rule is a regular expression. <br />
            If <em>Regex</em> is not checked, then the rule can be formatted using the wildcard <span class="codetext">'*'</span>, which stands for an arbitrary string of any length.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Action</span> to process if the corresponding expression matches. Possible actions:
      <ul id="seblist">
                <li><span class="quote">block</span><br />
                If the URL matches the expression, then it is rejected and processing of the remaining rules  is stopped.</li>
                <li><span class="quote">allow</span><br />
                  If the URL matches the expression, then it is accepted and processing of the remaining rules  is stopped.</li>
              </ul>
              <br />
            If the URL filter reaches  the last rule (means there was no matching block or allow expression found), then the URL is discarded. If you want the URL to be accepted if no matching block (or allow) expression was found, then add an <span class="codetext">'allow *'</span> expression.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Expression</span>:
              A Text field which contains  the filtering expression or pattern, either in a regular expression (Regex) format or a simpler filter expression containing the wildcard char <span class="codetext">'*'</span>. A filter expression can filter against all elements of a URL/URI according to <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986" target="_blank">RFC 3986</a>: <span class="codetext"><br />
              <br />
              scheme://user:password@host:port/path?query#fragment<br />
              <br />
              </span>      <span class="quote">Format for a filter expression in the non-regex format:</span><br />
              <ul id="seblist">
                <li>Scheme  is optional, and must be followed by <span class="codetext">'://'</span>.<br />
                </li>
                <li>The host field is required (besides when filtering against a protocol like about:blank or data:), and is either a partial or full hostname or an IP address. It can also contain or be replaced completely with the wildcard <span class="codetext">'*'</span> char, see below for details. The URL filter doesn't resolve hostnames itself, so if you allow everything and only block <span class="codetext">'hostname.com'</span>, then that host could still be reached using its IP address. You should therefore mainly use whitelisting to allow accessing only specific sites during an exam.</li>
                <li>An optional <span class="codetext">'.'</span> (dot) can prefix the host field to disable subdomain matching, see below for details.</li>
                <li>An optional port can come after the host and always has to start with the character <span class="codetext">':'</span>. It must be a valid port value from 1 to 65535.</li>
                <li>An optional path can come after the host or after the port and always has to start with the character <span class="codetext">'/'</span>. Parts of the path can be replaced with the wildcard char <span class="codetext">'*'</span>. If a path ends with a <span class="codetext">'/'</span>, that trailing <span class="codetext">'/'</span> is removed (as the filter doesn't distinguish paths with or without trailing <span class="codetext">'/'</span>).</li>
                <li>URL parameters like a query string can be indicated and always have to start with the character <span class="codetext">'?'</span>. Parts of the query can be replaced with the wildcard char <span class="codetext">'*'</span>.</li>
                <li>Filtering against a fragment usually doesn't make sense, as the content can be reached by scrolling the loaded page. Allowing specific fragments could force people to use a link to a particular anchor on a page (other links would not work).<br />
                  <br />
                  <span class="quote">      Examples for filter expressions:</span></li>
                <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'example.com'</strong></span> matches <span class="codetext">'example.com'</span>, <span class="codetext">'www.example.com'</span> and <span class="codetext">'www.mail.example.com'</span> (internally processed as a host name search for <span class="codetext">'example.com'</span> and a search for <span class="codetext">'*.example.com'</span>)</li>
                <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'.www.example.com'</strong></span> matches exactly <span class="codetext">'*://www.example.com'</span>  (no other subdomains)</li>
                <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'mail.*'</strong></span> matches all hosts having a subdomain or domain <span class="codetext">'mail'</span>, like  <span class="codetext">'mail.ethz.ch'</span>, <span class="codetext">'www.mail.gov.to'</span>, <span class="codetext">'mail.com'</span></li>
                <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'*:8088'</strong></span> matches all requests to port 8088</li>
                <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'example.com/stuff/*'</strong></span> matches all requests to any subdomain of <span class="codetext">'example.com'</span> that have <span class="codetext">'stuff'</span> as the first segment of the path<span class="codetext"></span></li>
                <li><strong><span class="codetext">'example.com/images/*.png'</span> </strong>matches all requests to any subdomain of <span class="codetext">'example.com'</span> that have <span class="codetext">'/images/'</span> as the first segment of the path and <span class="codetext">'.png'</span> as the path extension of an file URL (means it matches all PNG images in the <span class="codetext">'/images/'</span> directory or its subdirectories)<span class="codetext"></span></li>
                <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'*.net'</strong></span> matches all host with any kind of subdomains in the .net top level domain like <span class="codetext">'example.net'</span>, <span class="codetext">'www.example.net'</span>, <span class="codetext">'www.mail.example.net'</span></li>
                <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'*/*.net'</strong></span> matches all files with a <span class="codetext">'.net'</span> file extension on any host<br />
                  <br />
                  You should consider using a regular expression if performing complex filtering (when a simple filter doesn't cover all possible cases how that complex URL could be formatted) or split the expression into several filter rules.  
      
      The order of filter rules is not relevant.<br />

The  certificates added to this table will be embedded into a <span class="quote">.seb</span> settings file when it is saved and used on the SEB clients which are started up with that <span class="quote">.seb</span> exam configuration.

            <li><span class="quote">Debug certificate:</span> Debug certificates allow changing the DNS name (you can overwrite the certificate name in the certificate list), so a server with a wrong domain name is accepted if its domain is entered in the certificate name field.

If you have a .p12 or .pfx certificate archive file, you first need to import it into the <em>Windows Certificate Store</em> (usually you can just double click such a certificate file to invoke the Windows certificate import assistant). <strong>When importing the .p12/.pfx identity file, the included private key must be marked as &quot;exportable&quot;.</strong> The identities added to this table will be embedded into the <span class="quote">.seb</span> settings file. Use this feature  for creating a <span class="quote">.seb</span> file for configuring a client and add the identity or identities you like to use for encrypting/decrypting <span class="quote">.seb</span> files for starting exams later. When opening this <span class="quote">.seb</span> file on your exam clients, the embedded identities will be imported into the <em>Windows Certificate Store</em> (or <em>Keychain</em> on Macs), so that they can be used for decrypting exam settings later. Please note that during this process the  private keys imported into the Windows Certificate Store of the exam clients will be flagged as non-exportable for increased security. If you don't use a client config file with embedded identities to distribute the identity to the exam client devices, but a <strong>deployment system</strong>, you can deploy the identity certificates into Local Machine/Trusted People. Then they are available for all users on that machine (as Windows makes them available for all users in their Current User/Trusted People stores).</li>

Switching to the standard desktop is not possible, so other applications are invisible and cannot be reached during the exam. This kiosk mode may prevent specific third party software to run correctly together with SEB, like some screen recording software or the Windows on-screen keyboard (this is why this kiosk mode cannot be used with  touch optimized mode).</li>

All other applications running on the computer are hidden, prohibited applications are closed. Windows of all not permitted applications/processes are hidden (or if that's not possible those applications are killed) when they  open or try to come to the foreground.

              </strong>Activates the button &quot;Change a password...&quot; or &quot;Kennwort Ã¤ndern...&quot;, respectively.<br />
            </li>
            <li><strong>Enable Start Task Manager: </strong>Activates the button &quot;Start Task Manager&quot; or &quot;Task-Manager starten&quot;, respectively.<br />
              Note: Normally it makes no sense to permit the Task Manager inside SEB (thus during an online exam). Furthermore SEB is usually started in a new desktop (see option <span class="quote">CreateNewDesktop</span> in the <a href="win_usermanual_en.html#SecurityPane">Security Pane</a>), which would cover an eventual Task Manager window and make it invisible. In case you want to permit the Task Manager in SEB anyhow, <span class="quote">CreateNewDesktop</span> and <span class="quote">Monitor processes</span> must be disabled. An alternative possibility is to add the Task Manager as a third-party application <span class="codetext">TaskManager,taskmgr.exe;</span> to the <span class="quote">PermittedApplications</span> (see below).<br />
              </li>
            <li><strong>Enable Log off:&nbsp;
              </strong>Activates the button  &quot;Log off&quot; or &quot;Abmelden&quot;, respectively.<br />
              </li>
            <li><strong>Enable Shut down:&nbsp;
              </strong>Activates the button  &quot;Shutdown&quot; or &quot;Herunterfahren&quot; in the lower right corner.<br />
              </li>
            
            <li><strong>Set VMware configuration:</strong>&nbsp; Determines whether  the configuration value for VMware Client Shade will be set by SEB </li>
            <ul><li><strong>
              Enable VMware Client Shade:&nbsp;</strong>Activates  the &quot;Shade&quot; bar at the upper edge of a virtual desktop, if existent. If you're not using VMware, this setting doesn't have any effect.</li>
			</ul>	
			<li><strong>Enable Ease of Access:&nbsp;
              </strong>Activates the button &quot;Ease of Access&quot; or &quot;Erleichterter Zugriff&quot;  in the lower left corner, which offers help e.g. to visually or aurally handicapped persons, like the Magnifier Glass.<br />
            </li>
			 <li><strong>Enable network connection selector:&nbsp;
              </strong>Activates the button which allows to connect to WiFi networks, introduced in Windows 10. <br />
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>These Windows Registry options define the values while SEB is running. SEB remembers the settings which were active on the exam client computer before running SEB and resets them to the original values when exiting regularly. In case  SEB would crash or the user would enforce a reset of the machine while SEB was running, these options are reset to the original values:</p>
          <ul id="seblist">
            <li>when SEB is restarted once again and <strong>properly</strong> quit; </li>
            <li>or when uninstalling SEB. </li>
          </ul>
          <p><span class="red">There is also a  command line tool which can be used to reset those values for the unlikely case that the SEB Windows Service didn't work properly or was damaged and can't be run anymore.</span> This tool can be found in the Windows start menu or at the following directory path in your Program Files directory:</p>
          
          <pre>
                <p class="path">SafeExamBrowser\Reset\<span class="red">SafeExamBrowser.ResetUtility.exe</span></p>
          </pre>
          
          <p>You need to execute this tool as administrator (right mouse button context menu &quot;<span class="quote">Run as administrator</span>&quot;). In case the original values for the Registry Settings aren't found anymore, they will be reset to the Windows default values (all enabled). In this latter unlikely case you would also need to enter <strong>the short user name of the user in which account SEB was run</strong>, when the problem occurred. If you were running SEB in your administrator account, the short user name you have to enter usually isn't &quot;Admin&quot; or similar. It is the user name of the account which has the administrator role. The short user name is the same as the <strong>name of the user's home directory</strong> (if you go to C:\Users\ in a Windows Explorer window, you can see all user account names on this computer). If you have spaces in your short user name, enter it as it is, <strong>without quotes</strong>.</p>
