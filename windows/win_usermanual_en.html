            Safe Exam Browser 2.2 for Windows
          </h2>
    
          <p>Safe Exam Browser â€“ SEB for Windows opens a web browser window without navigation elements and locks the computer into a kiosk mode, which prevents from switching to other applications or quitting SEB untimely. <span class="half_linespace">SEB enables secure exams on unmanaged computers like students' own laptops as well as in managed environments</span>. Currently SEB integrates with the wide spread learning management systems (LMS) Moodle,  ILIAS and OpenOLAT and several commercial and non-commercial exam systems, as for example Inspera Assessment. Generally it can easily be used with most  web-based online quiz and e-assessment systems.          </p>
          <p><strong>The following manual explains how to configure and use SEB for Windows from the perspective of exam administrators.</strong> SEB is a very flexible and modular tool, therefore documentation for examinees on how to use SEB with individual exam setups and the various exam systems it works with should be provided by the institution using SEB or their e-assessment provider.</p>

          </h3>
          
        <p>SEB disables the options of the <strong>Windows Security Screen</strong> (invoked by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del), namely <strong>Lock (this Computer)</strong>, <strong>Switch User</strong>, <strong>Sign out (Log off</strong>), <strong>Change a password</strong>, <strong>(Start) Task Manager</strong>, <strong>Shut down, Restart </strong>and <strong>Ease of Access</strong>. It disables the <strong>Windows Task Bar</strong> and the <strong>Start Menu</strong> (button in the lower left corner of the screen), the <strong>App/Task/Window Switcher</strong> (invoked by Alt-Tab and Windows-Tab),  printing.  It can also be set whether  users can quit SEB and if it is required to enter a quit password to do so.</p>
        
        <p>Its possible to configure SEB to quit after the exam is submitted without having to enter a quit password by specifying a <span class="quote">quit link</span> and placing this on the summary page displayed by the LMS after submitting the exam.</p>
        
        <p>In the browser window there is no right mouse (or Shift-F10) click popup window available. Besides that, the browser is supporting  Java and Flash content (as long as the required  plugins are installed on the system). </p>
        
        <p>SEB detects when it was started in a virtual instead of a native environment and refuses to run. This virtual machine detector hinders manipulating SEB further when used in unmanaged environments.</p>
        
        <p>SEB for Windows is based on the <em><strong>Mozilla Firefox/Gecko</strong></em> engine (in contrast to the  <em><strong>WebKit</strong></em> browser engine used by SEB for macOS, which is also used by Safari and some open source browsers). </p>
        
        <p> SEB for Windows can be used together with additional (third party) applications during an exam. You can download and open files linked in your online exam, edit it in a third party application and then upload the results to your online quiz/LMS again. </p>
        <p>From version 2.0 SEB uses encrypted <span class="quote">.seb</span> setting files which allow to individually configure SEB per exam. Also see the  <a href="../presentations/HowTo_SEB2.0.pdf" target="_blank">how to use SEB 2.0 document</a> explaining the concept behind SEB 2.x.</p>
        <p><strong><span class="red">Please understand that you also have to configure your exam system correctly to be locked down securely.</span></strong> SEB is generally  locking down exam client computers only, not the exam system or the quiz module of a learning management system. <strong>Check documentation for your exam/learning management system on how to lock it down correctly.</strong> </p>
        <h4>New in SEB 2.2</h4>
        <p>SEB 2.2 for Windows is a major update with new features and many improvements. This version is replacing the SEB 2.1.x branch, with which it is <span class="red">compatible with one important exception</span>: <strong>If you defined URL filter rules in SEB 2.1.x for Windows, then you'll have to re-enter those in the 2.2 SEB Config Tool, following the new filter rule scheme.</strong> URL filter rules created and saved with SEB for macOS are already compatible with SEB 2.2 for Windows.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Using the powerful new feature <a href="#AdditionalResources">Additional Resources</a>, specific webpages, full or partial websites and documents can be accessed securely and easily in exams.</li>
          <li>Additional Resources can be opened using icons in the SEB task bar (similar to permitted applications) or with hierarchical popup menus.</li>
          <li>External Additional Resources use the improved URL filter to only allow displaying specific webpages, documents or sections of websites.</li>
          <li>Additional Resources can be embedded into SEB configuration files. An exam administrator can add documents like PDF files and HTML documents.</li>
          <li>Even full HTML5 web apps can be added as embedded Additional Resources, so they can be used in a fully offline exam scenario.</li>
          <li>You could deploy SEB Config Files containing an  HTML5/JavaScript exam player onto mobile devices and then perform an offline e-assessment.</li>
          <li>Improved URL filter which allows to use simple filter rules to effectively allow specific web pages/sites/content and block all others.</li>
          <li>Improved, refactored browser engine based on Firefox 52 ESR. This is the last Firefox version compatible with the XUL browser engine application used in SEB. We are already working on the next generation of SEB for Windows, which will be using a Chromium based browser engine (but this SEB 3.x branch won't replace the current Firefox-based SEB before 2019).</li>
          <li>Improved blocking of third party applications and tools for screen sharing and screen recording.</li>
          <li>Now preventing SEB being run in a remote session (using Remote Desktop Connection or similar on an exam client).</li>
          <li>Improved stability when setting and resetting Windows Registry settings to disable options like Task Manager, Switch User, Sign out and Shut down (accessible with the Ctrl+Alt+Del shortcut) during the exam and re-enabling them when quitting SEB.</li>
          <li>Integrated secure viewer for PDF files.</li>
          <li>Added Audio Control Component to SEB task bar, which allows to increase/decrease and mute system audio volume. Audio can be muted or the audio level preset when starting SEB.</li>
          <li>SEB Config Files can now be loaded from servers using authentication (Basic, OAuth etc.) using seb(s):// links. Even indirect links (not containing the  file name with the .seb extension, like for example sebs://example.com/download.php?id=2352) are possible. This allows to store a SEB exam settings file for example into the same Moodle course as the quiz. The login session is remembered, therefore students don't have to login twice in SEB if you start SEB/an exam using a seb(s):// link to a config file on an authenticated server. Note: Starting SEB by opening a seb(s):// linked config file from an authenticated server isn't supported in SEB for Windows 2.2 yet, such indirect seb(s) links can only be opened from inside SEB (for example from an exam portal/landing page).</li>
          <li>Added a page loading (network activity) indicator.</li>
          <li>Added a browser window toolbar, similar to SEB for macOS, with reload and back/forward buttons.</li>
          <li>Navigation in browser history (back/forward) can now be allowed/disabled separately for the exam and additional browser windows.</li>
          <li>The browser user agent string now reflects the operating system SEB is running on and allows a custom suffix string to be added.</li>
          <li>Added new asymmetric/symmetric encryption for config files using identity certificate for better performance when decrypting certificate encrypted config files.</li>
          <li>Fixed on-screen keyboard wasn't displayed in latest versions of Windows 10. Now "Tablet Mode" needs to be activated in the system when using SEB in its "Touch optimized" mode.        </li>
        </ul>

            Using SEB with Supported LMS
          </h3>
          
          <p>Some learning management systems require plugins to be installed to fully support secure exams taken with SEB, others have built-in support.</p>

          <h4 class="seb-section-header sebnavbar-link" id="moodle">
            <a class="anchorjs-link" href="#moodle"></a>
            Using SEB with Moodle</strong>
          </h4>
          
          <p> SEB support in Moodle has the following objectives:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Don't display any links during an exam which would allow to navigate to other sections of Moodle or even other websites. This means the course navigation, link to the user's Moodle profile, logout, link to the University homepage etc. needs to be disabled/hidden. Only the quiz navigation (to navigate to other questions) and the &quot;Finish attempt...&quot; link  should be visible </li>
            <li>Make sure a quiz can only be taken using Safe Exam Browser, display an error message if trying to open the quiz in another web browser. </li>
            <li>Optionally check if the correct version of SEB and  legitimate SEB settings are used.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>There are two options how to activate SEB support in Moodle. Both achieve the above objectives 1 and 2. Only the second option also ensures objective 3 is met:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Enable the &quot;classic&quot;  SEB support in Moodle: <a href="https://docs.moodle.org/28/en/Safe_exam_browser" target="_blank">How to activate the SEB secure browser mode in a Moodle quiz</a>. Then configure the quiz at <span class="quote">Administration / Quiz administration / Edit settings / Extra restrictions on attempts / Browser security / Require the use of Safe Exam Browser</span>. This option uses only a basic, not very secure check for the used browser. This may be safe enough if students can only access the exam from centrally managed university computers inside a computer lab/exam room. For other scenarios like BYOD you should use the second option.</li>
            <li>Use the  <span class="quote"> Browser Exam Key</span> authentication in Moodle for the connecting SEB version and its settings by installing the <a href="https://github.com/moodleou/moodle-quizaccess_safeexambrowser" target="_blank">quiz access rule plugin</a> in Moodle. In addition you will have to copy the Browser Exam Key hash code string into the quiz settings (<span class="quote">Administration / Quiz administration / Edit settings / Extra restrictions on attempts / Allowed browser keys</span>). This key is generated by SEB when you save the settings you intend to use for the exam. As this key includes a hash (checksum) of both the saved exam settings and the code signature of the used SEB version, you may have to generate and copy several Browser Exam Keys into the Moodle quiz settings, for example one for the Windows version of SEB and one for the Mac version.</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>Sometimes hiding course navigation, link to the user's Moodle profile, logout etc. doesn't work as expected because <span class="red">some custom Moodle themes don't support the secure browser mode of Moodle correctly, they display links with which students can get out of the quiz during an exam.</span> If this happens only with your customized theme and not the standard Moodle theme, then your theme is not implemented correctly. In that case you should fix the problem in your custom Moodle theme.  You may also create URL filter rules which only allow to access the exam and no other parts of Moodle, but this is not trivial and we cannot provide you with any support on that. </p>
          <p>You may find additional information and help in the discussion boards for <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/seb/discussion/" target="_blank">SEB</a> and <a href="https://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=737" target="_blank">Moodle</a>.</p>

          <p>You can find information about how to install the ILIAS plugin for SEB support <a href="https://github.com/hrz-unimr/Ilias.SEBPlugin" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
          
          <p>Please note that currently  support for Safe Exam Browser in ILAS can only be switched on for some roles of a whole installation, not a single exam/course.</p>

            <strong>Using SEB with OpenOLAT</strong>
          </h4>
          
          <p>An assessment mode has been added to the OpenOLAT standard with the 10.2 release. The assessment mode allows course authors to limit the functionality and access of OpenOLAT courses for exam settings. An exam setting is not limited to online tests however,  IMS QTI assessments, SCORM modules, external LTI 1.1 tools and all other OpenOLAT course elements can be configured for such an exam setting. </p>
          
          <p>One of the many security features is the enforced usage of  Safe Exam Browser. An exam setting can be configured with multiple <a href="win_usermanual_en.html#ExamPane">Browser Exam Key</a> keys.</p>
          
          <p>No additional software needs to be installed in order to use the assessment mode together with  Safe Exam Browser. The assessment mode is globally enabled / disabled in Administration -&gt; Modules -&gt; Assessment mode. Within the courses the configuration is done in the course menu. </p>

          <p>You can download the SEB for Windows Installation setup program (also containing the SEB Windows configuration tool) <a href="../download_en.html#Windows">here</a>. Just start <span class="path">SafeExamBrowserInstaller.exe</span> and follow the steps in the installation program. </p>
          
          <p>SEB for Windows containing the main application executable <span class="path">SafeExamBrowser.exe</span> and the configuration tool <span class="path">SebWindowsConfig.exe</span> are placed in the SEB application folder named <span class="path">SafeExamBrowser</span> which will be installed into the standard program folder of your computer (usually <span class="path">C:\Program Files</span> or <span class="path">C:\Program Files (x86)</span>, depending on whether you have a 32-bit or 64-bit machine). Also a <span class="path">Safe Exam Browser</span> program  entry will be placed into your Start Menu.<br />

            Starting and Quitting SEB
          </h3>
          
          <p>When you start SEB, all currently running applications, the Windows Task Bar and the desktop are hidden. On the main screen SEB opens its web browser window filling the whole screen (optionally the window can be resized and moved or switched to fullscreen). SEB opens the webpage at the preset Start URL, which might take some seconds. As default, as long as you don't set another <span class="quote">Start URL</span> (see <a href="#configuration">Configuration</a>), SEB for Windows opens <a href="https://safeexambrowser.org/start/" target="_blank">this page</a> with initial instructions. </p>
          <p>SEB doesn't have any navigation buttons, but the optional reload button in the SEB task bar, the browser toolbar (if activated) or the key  <strong>F5</strong>   can be used to reload the current page.</p>
          
          <p>To quit SEB (while it's using the default settings), just press the <span class="quote">Quit</span> button in the SEB task bar, keys <span class="quote">Ctrl-Q</span> or the red close button in the browser window. Quitting SEB can optionally be switched off or password protected, also the function key exit sequence which was used in former SEB versions is still supported optionally. When SEB quits, the applications which were running before starting it will get unhidden again (as long as settings didn't force to quit those applications).</p>

            Configuration
          </h3>
        
          <p>SEB for Windows has a comfortable configuration tool which should be used for configuring SEB. You can find <span class="path">SEBConfigTool.exe </span>in the SEB application folder <span class="path">SafeExamBrowser</span> which is placed in the standard program folder of your computer (usually <span class="path">C:\Program Files</span> or <span class="path">C:\Program Files (x86)</span>, depending on whether you have a 32-bit or 64-bit machine). </p>
          
          <p>In the SEB configuration<em><strong></strong></em> tool window, settings are grouped in several panes. There you can set  the parameters described below.</p>
          
          <ul id="seblist">
            <li>In the <span class="quote">General</span> pane you'll find  basic settings like the URL which SEB opens and the passwords to  open a config file for editing and to quit/restart SEB. When first time using SEB, you might only have to change these general settings, as the default values for all other settings should reflect the more &quot;secure&quot; option.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Config File</span> contains details about encryption of the SEB <span class="quote">.seb</span> configuration files plus all functions to deal with opening, saving, reverting, duplicating and applying settings. These commands can also be accessed in the menu bar above the tab bar. </li>
            <li><span class="quote">User Interface</span> contains general SEB user interface settings; </li>
            <li><span class="quote">Browser</span> all detail settings for the built-in SEB web browser. </li>
            <li><span class="quote">Down/Uploads</span> refers to   file downloads and uploads;</li>
            <li> <span class="quote">Exam</span> handles the connection to  exam systems and exam specific settings. </li>
            <li><span class="quote">Application</span> is for handling  permitted and prohibited processes; </li>

            <li><span class="quote">Administrator password</span>: Password required to open a config file for editing in the config tool. You should set an administrator password if you don't want that someone could  open and examine a <span class="quote">.seb</span> configuration file, after knowing the encryption credentials (for example after an exam). <br />
              <strong>If you're using macOS SEB clients  for exams as well, you definitely should set an administrator password</strong>, as otherwise students could open the preferences window (which is build into SEB for macOS)  and change settings during the exam.</li>

            <li><span class="quote">Allow user to quit SEB</span>: If selected, Users can quit SEB with the <strong>Quit button</strong> in the SEB taskbar, by pressing the keys <strong>Ctrl-Q</strong> or by clicking the <strong>main browser window</strong> (the one that displays the exam) <strong>close button</strong>. Otherwise you can shutdown or reboot the computer. In a computer room in a university or school you could for example use some tool to shutdown or reboot all computers after a exam and therefore not allow students to quit SEB themselves at all. <strong>This setting has no influence on a Quit Link</strong> (if one is set, see <a href="win_usermanual_en.html#ExamPane">Exam Pane</a>).</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Ignore exit keys</span>: If selected, SEB ignores the exit keys and can only be quit manually by entering the quit password after clicking the Quit button in the SEB taskbar, by pressing the keys Ctrl-Q or by clicking the main browser window close button.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Quit/restart password</span>: This password is prompted when users try to quit SEB with the Quit button, <span class="quote">Ctrl-Q</span> or the red close button in the main browser window (if not in full screen mode).   If no quit password is set, then SEB just prompts &quot;Are you sure you want to quit SEB?&quot;. The password is not prompted when using a <strong>Quit Link</strong>.<br />
            This password is also prompted if the <span class="quote">restart exam button</span> is used (if activated and configured to be password protected, see <a href="win_usermanual_en.html#ExamPane">Exam Pane</a>). </li>
            <li><span class="quote">Confirm quit/restart password</span>: Retype the quit password. As long as it's not matching the quit/restart password typed in the field above, <span class="quote">&quot;Please enter correct confirm password</span>&quot; is displayed below and you cannot save settings.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Exit sequence</span>: Function keys which have to be pressed and held down together   to exit SEB. This works only if <span class="quote">ignore exit keys</span> is not selected. Some combinations don't work as Windows doesn't allow to use some keys/combinations, this also differs depending on hardware and key map, so you should test the exit key combination on all the clients you use. <span class="red">We recommend to no longer use exit keys, this feature will probably be removed in future SEB versions.</span> <strong>Note: SEB for macOS doesn't support exit keys, so in mixed environments you should anyways prefer using a quit password for manually quitting  SEB.</strong></li>

              <p><strong>Please note:</strong> On a managed exam computer you probably should copy the default client settings file <span class="path">SebClientSettings.seb</span>  to the <strong class="path">\ProgramData\SafeExamBrowser\</strong> directory. If such a file exists in this location, this will be read by SEB with first priority and another file at the <span class="quote">Local Application Data</span> folder of the current user will be ignored. As the PROGRAMDATA directory usually is writable only with administrator rights, regular users cannot change the exam computer's default settings, which is the desired case on a managed computer. <br>
              <strong>You should only use a client settings file<span class="path">SebClientSettings.seb</span> in the <span class="path">\ProgramData\SafeExamBrowser\</span> directory on deployed exam client machines, not on your admin workstation, as SEB will ignore all local client settings which you configure in the Config Tool </strong>(&quot;Use Current Settings to Configure Client&quot;, &quot;Revert Settings to Local Client Settings&quot; and  &quot;Apply and Restart SEB&quot; won't work as expected,  see also below)<strong>!</strong></p>

            <li><span class="quote">Choose identity to be used for encrypting SEB settings file ...</span> In this popup menu  all identities (X.509 certificates with RSA public key and associated private key) in the Windows Certificate Store are listed, which can be used for encrypting and decrypting. Install that identity on your SEB clients, then they can decrypt <span class="quote">.seb</span> files encrypted with this certificate/key. You can also make identities available to specific computers in a network zone over the LAN without placing them physically onto the exam clients (ask your Windows network administrators about that). You can install identities on client computers using deployment systems or by embedding them into a <span class="quote">.seb</span> config file for configuring the client (see <a href="win_usermanual_en.html#Certificates">Network / Certificates</a> pane).</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Use old asymmetric-only encryption (for SEB &lt; 2.2)</span>: SEB 2.2 can use a new encryption method for identity-encrypted config files, which can decrypt large settings much faster. This is especially important if you embed large additional resources into config files. But if you need to save config files compatible to earlier SEB versions  (before 2.2, also current macOS versions of SEB) then you should use this setting.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Settings password</span>: Password to decrypt the settings file, if one is set then it will be prompted when SEB reads the settings. <span class="red"><strong>Local client settings</strong></span><strong> (saved on every exam client, at one of the two possible standard paths, see above) <span class="red">should be saved with the option &quot;Use SEB settings file for ... configuring a client&quot;, so you (and examinees when starting SEB) don't have to enter any settings password</span>.</strong> Then a standard password is used for encrypting these settings. This is not very safe, but you should anyways not store any really secret information (like critical admin and quit passwords or a secret exam URL) in the local client settings, for that you should use  separate settings files saved with the option <span class="quote">&quot;Use SEB settings file for ... starting an exam</span>&quot;.</li>

You have to either enter a password or choose a cryptographic identity with which the SEB settings file will be encrypted.

            <li><span class="quote">Use browser window</span>: Use a window for the SEB browser which can be scaled and moved around, also to another screen when available. One advantage of using a browser window is that if you're using a large wide screen display, some web pages may not be ergonomic to read. With the scalable browser window you can adjust the width of displayed web pages.</li>

            <li><span class="quote">Use full screen mode</span>: Display the SEB browser full screen. Full screen browser mode should mainly be used with exam systems which display everything in one main window and don't open auxiliary windows: When a web page opens in a new window, this will be hidden behind the full screen main browser window when the user clicks into that. From SEB 2.1 you can access single windows in the SEB task bar (click on the SEB icon) or with Alt-Tab.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Touch optimized</span>: Enables the touch optimized mode for Windows tablet computers (for Windows 8.1 and 10) featuring:

            <li><span class="quote">Hide toolbar as default</span>  (Mac only): After SEB starts, the browser window toolbar is hidden. Users can unhide the toolbar in the view menu or the contextual menu on the browser window title bar. </li>
            <li><span class="quote">Show menu bar</span>  (Mac only): The menu bar can be used in SEB for macOS to access menu bar widgets like changing keyboard layouts, re-connecting to a WiFi network etc.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Show SEB task bar</span>: Usually to be used when you permit third party applications, which are displayed as icons. Clicking on the icon of an application starts it (if it wasn't running yet), brings the application to foreground or maximizes its window if it was minimized before. The task bar is not required, users can also switch to third party applications using the task switcher with keys Alt-Tab. But if users quit a third party application,  they can restart it only by using its task bar icon (or by opening a file which is linked in an exam and gets opened by that application).

            <li><span class="quote">Allow audio capture (microphone)</span>: Allow web applications to access microphone (using HMTL 5 APIs).</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Allow navigating back/forward in exam</span>: Disabling browsing to previously visited pages (by Ctrl-Cursor left) increases security, because it might be possible to leave an exam by browsing back to an external start page.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Allow navigating in additional windows</span>: Disabling browsing to previously visited pages (by Ctrl-Cursor left) might not be desired for additional resources and other content opening in additional browser windows, therefore this separate setting.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Allow reload in exam</span>: You can disable reload completely (reload button in task bar, browser tool bar, iOS side slider menu, keyboard shortcut F5/cmd+R) with this setting, as  offline caching in some e-assessment systems might break when the user tries to reload a page without internet connection.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Allow reload in additional windows</span>:  For additional resources and other content opening in additional browser windows reload can be enabled/disabled separately with this setting.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Show reload warning in exam</span>: SEB shows a warning asking the user to confirm reloading the main browser containing the exam.</li>

            <li><span class="quote">User agent for touch/tablet mode</span>: Allows to switch between the default, an iPad-like and a custom browser user agent string for SEB Windows running in  the touch optimized mode (on tablet computers). SEB appends its version number automatically to the selected user agent string.</li>
            <li> <span class="quote">iPad</span>: Use an iPad-like user agent string for the touch optimized/tablet mode, as many mobile optimized websites recognize this user agent, but not the Windows tablet touch user agent. </li>
            <li><span class="quote">User agent (Mac)</span>: Allows to switch between the default and a custom browser user agent string in SEB for macOS running in  desktop mode. The default string depends on the installed Safari/WebKit version and therefore can differ on exam clients. SEB for macOS also appends its version number automatically to the selected user agent string.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Use SEB without browser window</span>: If you intend to use another application for an exam and don't need to display any web content on the exam client, you can switch off the SEB browser with this option. Don't try to disable XULRunner in the Application -&gt; Permitted Processes tab, that isn't necessary when using this option.</li>

            <li><span class="quote">by only allowing to upload the same file downloaded before</span>: 
              If the file is not found,  an error message is presented.

This option is useful when you <span class="quote">allow to switch to third party applications</span> and want to use some PDF forms which have to be filled out by  the examinees/users.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Allow using Acrobat Reader PDF plugin (insecure)</span>: The Adobe Acrobat Reader browser plugin should only be used on secured managed Mac computers, as it allows to access the file system and  cloud services.</li>

            <strong class="red">PLEASE NOTE:</strong> <span class="red">Every new SEB version generates a different Browser Exam Key</span> (as code and configuration option changes are reflected in the key, this is the idea of the request header check using this key together with compatible exam systems). If you want to use an existing exam configuration with a new SEB version, you have to re-calculate the Browser Exam Key with the new version and copy the new key to the quiz settings in your SEB compatible examination system (Moodle,  ILIAS and OpenOLAT allow you to specify several keys in case you want to  allow your examinees to use for example the current and previous SEB version).      </li>
            <li><span class="quote">Link to quit SEB after exam</span>: Its possible to configure SEB to quit after the exam is submitted without having to enter a quit password by specifying a <span class="quote">quit link</span> (full URL starting with http:// or https://) and placing this on the summary page displayed by the LMS after submitting the exam.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Ask user to confirm quitting</span>: If not selected, then SEB is quit immediately after a Quit Link is detected, without users having to confirm.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Back to Start button</span>: Either check the &quot;<span class="quote">Use Start URL</span>&quot; option or enter a link to which the exam is redirected when the Back to Start button is pressed. The browser session is not restarted using this feature (session cookies are not cleared; a logged in user isn't logged out). The Back to Start button is displayed in the SEB task bar when either the &quot;Use Start URL&quot; option is selected or a link is entered.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Title/tool tip text for the Back to Start button</span>: This text is displayed as the title of the confirmation alert and as tool tip on the icon. Leave empty for a standard text (which is localized to the SEB user interface languages).</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Protect  Back to Start button with the quit/restart password</span>: The quit/restart password (if set, see <a href="win_usermanual_en.html#GeneralPane">General</a> pane) must be entered when the Back to Start button was tapped.

            Settings in the Applications Pane
          </h4>
          <p>You can allow third party applications to be used while SEB is running. Usually you would enable the SEB task bar, then for each allowed application (with the setting &quot;Icon in task bar&quot; enabled) an application icon will be displayed in the SEB task bar. Clicking on the icon  starts the application when it's not yet running or brings its window(s) to the foreground. If a running application has several windows open, SEB displays a window chooser. You can switch between open windows with  keys Alt-Tab as well.</p>
          <p>SEB allows only applications to run which are configured in &quot;Permitted Processes&quot; (as long as the &quot;Monitor processes&quot; setting below is active). But SEB cannot prevent these applications from:</p>
          <p><strong>â€¢ Accessing the file system (local or network drives).</strong> So if you use an application which can open and save files and displays a file dialog, students can access local and network drives on the exam computer. </p>
          <p><strong>â€¢ Accessing the internet.</strong> SEB only has a URL filter for the built-in browser, other applications and the system are not blocked from accessing the internet. So any third party software with a built-in help browser or similar can be used to cheat during an exam.</p>
          <p>Therefore using such applications requires additional measures, as for example a  drive which is cleaned before every exam on a managed computer and a firewall (either hardware or firewall filter rules in a virtual desktop, see below). If you intend to use SEB with third party applications on unmanaged computers (BYOD, student owned machines), you should run the exam including those third party applications in a secured virtual machine, usually this would be a virtual desktop. <a href="http://safeexambrowser.org/vdi/Competence-Oriented_Exams_VDI+SEB_ETH-LET_2017_03.pdf" target="_blank">This technical paper</a> describes the virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) environment <a href="https://www.ethz.ch/en.html" target="_blank">ETH Zurich</a> (the top ranked  university in continental Europe which is the driving force behind the development of SafeExamBrowser) is using for such exams. For other (less technical) papers on our exam environment, see our <a href="../about_publications_en.html">publications</a> page. Our environment runs on managed computers and uses the VMware View Client software secured by SEB on the local machine and another instance of SEB running inside the virtual desktop, allowing to use the configured permitted third party applications in addition to an exam displayed by the SEB browser. In a bring-your-own-device scenario you would ideally use VDI with a technology like <a href="https://www.vmware.com/pdf/horizon-view/horizon-html-access-4x-document.pdf" target="_blank">VMware Horizon View HTML Access</a>. Then students just need to install/run SEB on their Windows or Mac laptops. SEB would be configured to only load and display the HTML Access portal page in a full screen browser window (ideally without displaying the SEB task bar/dock). The entire exam takes place in the virtual desktop, which can be perfectly secured. You also don't have to worry about distributing, configuring and licensing those third party applications you want to use in exams to students, as you just have to install and configure these applications once on the master image for the VDI exam pool. If an exam computer breaks down during the exam, no data is lost, as everything is running inside the virtual desktop on your server infrastructure. Usually such exams would have a browser-based part, where you place the questions and maybe template files, which students then can open in the permitted third party applications. After they finish working on those documents, they can save the results and upload them into the exam, using a file upload question type. Students can only interact with the empty file system inside the virtual desktop, they also cannot access the local file systems or connected USB sticks on their BYOD exam computers.</p>
          
          <h5 class="seb-section-header">Setting options:</h5>
          
          <ul id="seblist">
            <li><span class="quote">Monitor processes while SEB is running:</span> If enabled, SEB prevents non-permitted processes to display any windows (including alerts, message boxes etc.) by hiding them immediately. If SEB cannot hide such a process (because it is running with the rights of another user, for example SYSTEM) SEB terminates it. For the &quot;<span class="quote">Disable Explorer Shell</span>&quot; kiosk mode (see <a href="win_usermanual_en.html#SecurityPane">Security</a> pane), &quot;Monitor processes...&quot; should always be activated (which was implicitly the case in former SEB versions), but from SEB 2.1 you can (and should in most cases) use this feature also with the &quot;Create new desktop&quot; kiosk mode. </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Besides the live process monitoring while  running,  when SEB is started,  an alert/dialogue window is displayed to tell the user to quit the currently running applications (which are  in the list of  permitted and prohibited processes) and to restart SEB afterwards or to let SEB kill the applications risking that there could be data loss. Applications which have the <span class="quote">Force quit</span> parameter set are automatically terminated (without asking the user).</p>

            <li><span class="quote">Allow  switching to third party applications</span> (Mac only): If this option is activated, the kiosk mode induced by SEB will be reduced one level. The process switcher (<span class="quote">Cmd-Tab</span>) will work, so it's possible to switch to other running applications.<br />
              Use this option only when running SEB in a user account managed by parental controls, with only SEB and the desired applications allowed. Also you should switch on <span class="quote">Simple Finder</span> and don't give users access to other accounts with administrator rights on that computer (see SEB for macOS manual: <a href="../macosx/mac_usermanual_en.html#secure_environment">Secure Environment</a>). <br />

            <li>        <span class="quote">Allow Flash to switch to full screen mode</span> (Mac only): Playing videos with Flash in full screen mode is a security problem. That's why it is strongly recommended to use HTML5 video (there full screen mode is no problem) instead of Flash whenever possible. Depending on the Flash video player and the Mac used, it can be difficult to switch back from full screen mode (best is to use the <span class="quote">Esc</span> key), so if you don't need full screen mode, don't enable it here.
              <br />

            <li><span class="quote">Description</span>: Optional, should explain what kind of process this is, because this might not be obvious only from the executable's name.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">OS</span>: Indicates on which operating system the permitted process runs (currently only the option <span class="quote">Win</span> works).</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Executable</span>: File name of the executable, <strong>which should not contain any parts of a file system path</strong>, only the filename of the exe file (like <span class="quote">calc.exe</span>).</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Original Name</span>: Original file name of the executable. Some files don't have this meta data information. If it is available, SEB will prioritize this string over the  Executable file name string.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Window Handling Process</span>: Process executable which is actually handling the main window, this is necessary to indicate for Java and some other applications (for example OpenOffice, Eclipse, Adobe Acrobat).</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Path</span>: Optional filesystem path (formatted system specific) to the process executable's directory <strong>excluding the filename, see field executable</strong>. If the path is not given or relative, then SEB searches the system provided paths for applications. For applications which have been installed and properly registered in Windows  App Paths you don't need to specify the path.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Arguments</span>  to append to the executable  of the application when starting it. You can select if an argument is <span class="quote">active</span> or not (for testing). You can add and remove arguments using the <span class="quote">+/-</span> buttons.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Icon in task bar</span>: Disabling this option is mainly useful for background processes (not requiring user interaction) which you want to autostart when SEB is run.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Autostart</span>: Start the process automatically together with SEB.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Identifier:</span> String of the process identifier in reverse domain notation (Mac) or the string or substring of the main window title of a process which doesn't have a MainWindow handle (Win), this is usually the case with Java applications (use for example &quot;OpenOffice&quot; for OpenOffice Calc). </li>
            <li><span class="quote">Allow running in background</span>: Permitted processes with this option set are allowed to already be running when starting SEB. In this case SEB doesn't ask the user if the process can be terminated before continuing to start SEB. Processes with the option &quot;Allow running in background&quot; don't have an icon in the SEB task bar. They can nevertheless have the option &quot;Autostart&quot; set, in this case SEB attempts to start the permitted process regardless if it was already running or not (and the option &quot;Icon in task bar&quot; is considered in this case). <br />
            <strong>      If you need some background process running together with SEB and this process might display some window or alert/message box, you have to add this process's executable to permitted processes with the option &quot;Allow running in background&quot; set, otherwise SEB will hide the window of the background process when &quot;Monitor processes&quot; is selected (or even terminate that process, in case it cannot be hidden).</strong></li>
            <li><span class="quote">Allow user to select location of application</span>: The user is presented a file dialog window allowing to locate the third party application's executable if it cannot be found at the path specified and  paths provided by the system (instead of just displaying an error message). Only applications matching the executable string specified are accepted.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Force quit</span>: Indicates whether an application/process may be terminated in a not-nice way, what may cause data loss if the application had unsaved data in memory or was just writing to a persistent memory/drive. If this application is safe to be terminated anytime, then enabling this setting  helps to avoid bothering users: Because if this setting is disabled and the application is running when SEB is started, then an alert/dialogue window is displayed to ask the user to quit this permitted application together with other permitted and the prohibited applications and to restart SEB afterwards (or to let SEB terminate the applications risking that there could be data loss).<br />
      Disabling this setting  does not mean that processes are not killed: Depending on the platform's capabilities, SEB first tries to terminate prohibited processes and applications nicely or asking the user to do it themselves, if this doesn't work then it terminates them anyways (as long as <em>monitor processes</em> is enabled). But enabling <em>Force quit</em> will speed up this process.<br />
      This flag should not be set for macOS applications which allow to be terminated nicely (they are anyways automatically terminated, without asking the user).</li>
            <!--<li><span class="quote">Code Signatures</span>: Displays detail information about the code signatures which allow to undoubtedly identify the process or application. To cover different versions of a process/application, multiple signatures can be added. This isn't necessary if the processes/applications are signed with a trusted signature (on OS X), because the signature identifies an application independently of the program version. Also you can generate code signatures here. <strong>Not yet available in SEB 2.0.</strong></li>-->
          </ul>
          <p>Java applications (like OpenOffice) can  be used as permitted processes, but require specific settings: The title of their main window must be defined in  the field <span class="quote">Permitted Processes -&gt; Identifier</span> (for example &quot;OpenOffice Calc&quot;), the required main executable in <span class="quote">Permitted Processes -&gt; Executable</span> (&quot;scalc.exe&quot;) and the process which is actually handling the main window in <span class="quote">Permitted Processes -&gt; Window Handling Process(es)</span> (&quot;soffice.bin&quot;). For this example the executable path should be entered as &quot;program&quot; in <span class="quote">Permitted Processes -&gt; Path</span>, as that is the relative path to the main executable from the OpenOffice main directory, which is registered in Windows <span class="quote">App Paths</span>.</p>

This list of prohibited processes makes sense because SEB on both platforms usually allows to run system processes, but some of them might not be wanted during an exam.

          <ul id="seblist">
            <li><span class="quote">Activate URL filtering</span>: Filter URLs when loading web pages using the filter set defined below.<br />
            </li>
            <li> <span class="quote">Filter also embedded content</span>: If selected, also all embedded resources will be filtered using the filter set.    Note that there can be hundreds of resources such as images and other media per page, so filtering all content may slow down page loading.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The table contains  URL filter rules, consisting of a <span class="quote">allow</span> or <span class="quote">block</span> action. The URL filter always first processes rules with the block action, if one matches, then the according http request is discarded. If no block rule matched, then rules with an allow action are processed. If one matches, then the request is loaded. If no allow rule matched, then the request is discarded.<br />
          Discarding a http request means that a link with the URL is not followed and the user is notified with an alert. When content filtering is enabled, an embedded resource with the according URL is not loaded, in this case there's no notification about that, but it is written to the log. Create a new rule  by clicking the<span class="codetext">'+'</span> button below the table. Remove a rule by selecting it in the table and clicking the <span class="codetext">'-'</span> button.</p>
          
          <p>SEB automatically creates an allow filter rule for the exact address of the <span class="quote">Start URL</span> defined in these settings. This means that if your <span class="quote">Start URL</span> is <span class="path">example.com</span>, then all pages and resources in the domain example.com  will be allowed. If your <span class="quote">Start URL</span> is <span class="path">example.com/exams/engineering2015-1.html</span>, then only the pages with this exact address will be allowed. In this case you have to manually add an allow filter rule so all pages and resources your exam uses will be allowed (like <span class="path">example.com/exams/*</span>).</p>
          
          <p class="seb-section-header quote">Rules</p>
          
          <ul id="seblist">
            <li><span class="quote">Active</span>:
              Indicates if the rule is active.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Regex</span>:
              Indicates if the  rule is a regular expression. <br />
            If <em>Regex</em> is not checked, then the rule can be formatted using the wildcard <span class="codetext">'*'</span>, which stands for an arbitrary string of any length.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Action</span> to process if the corresponding expression matches. Possible actions:
      <ul id="seblist">
                <li><span class="quote">block</span><br />
                If the URL matches the expression, then it is rejected and processing of the remaining rules  is stopped.</li>
                <li><span class="quote">allow</span><br />
                  If the URL matches the expression, then it is accepted and processing of the remaining rules  is stopped.</li>
              </ul>
              <br />
            If the URL filter reaches  the last rule (means there was no matching block or allow expression found), then the URL is discarded. If you want the URL to be accepted if no matching block (or allow) expression was found, then add an <span class="codetext">'allow *'</span> expression.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Expression</span>:
              A Text field which contains  the filtering expression or pattern, either in a regular expression (Regex) format or a simpler filter expression containing the wildcard char <span class="codetext">'*'</span>. A filter expression can filter against all elements of a URL/URI according to <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986" target="_blank">RFC 3986</a>: <span class="codetext"><br />
              <br />
              scheme://user:password@host:port/path?query#fragment<br />
              <br />
              </span>      <span class="quote">Format for a filter expression in the non-regex format:</span><br />
              <ul id="seblist">
                <li>Scheme  is optional, and must be followed by <span class="codetext">'://'</span>.<br />
                </li>
                <li>The host field is required (besides when filtering against a protocol like about:blank or data:), and is either a partial or full hostname or an IP address. It can also contain or be replaced completely with the wildcard <span class="codetext">'*'</span> char, see below for details. The URL filter doesn't resolve hostnames itself, so if you allow everything and only block <span class="codetext">'hostname.com'</span>, then that host could still be reached using its IP address. You should therefore mainly use whitelisting to allow accessing only specific sites during an exam.</li>
                <li>An optional <span class="codetext">'.'</span> (dot) can prefix the host field to disable subdomain matching, see below for details.</li>
                <li>An optional port can come after the host and always has to start with the character <span class="codetext">':'</span>. It must be a valid port value from 1 to 65535.</li>
                <li>An optional path can come after the host or after the port and always has to start with the character <span class="codetext">'/'</span>. Parts of the path can be replaced with the wildcard char <span class="codetext">'*'</span>. If a path ends with a <span class="codetext">'/'</span>, that trailing <span class="codetext">'/'</span> is removed (as the filter doesn't distinguish paths with or without trailing <span class="codetext">'/'</span>).</li>
                <li>URL parameters like a query string can be indicated and always have to start with the character <span class="codetext">'?'</span>. Parts of the query can be replaced with the wildcard char <span class="codetext">'*'</span>.</li>
                <li>Filtering against a fragment usually doesn't make sense, as the content can be reached by scrolling the loaded page. Allowing specific fragments could force people to use a link to a particular anchor on a page (other links would not work).<br />
                  <br />
                  <span class="quote">      Examples for filter expressions:</span></li>
                <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'example.com'</strong></span> matches <span class="codetext">'example.com'</span>, <span class="codetext">'www.example.com'</span> and <span class="codetext">'www.mail.example.com'</span> (internally processed as a host name search for <span class="codetext">'example.com'</span> and a search for <span class="codetext">'*.example.com'</span>)</li>
                <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'.www.example.com'</strong></span> matches exactly <span class="codetext">'*://www.example.com'</span>  (no other subdomains)</li>
                <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'mail.*'</strong></span> matches all hosts having a subdomain or domain <span class="codetext">'mail'</span>, like  <span class="codetext">'mail.ethz.ch'</span>, <span class="codetext">'www.mail.gov.to'</span>, <span class="codetext">'mail.com'</span></li>
                <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'*:8088'</strong></span> matches all requests to port 8088</li>
                <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'example.com/stuff/*'</strong></span> matches all requests to any subdomain of <span class="codetext">'example.com'</span> that have <span class="codetext">'stuff'</span> as the first segment of the path<span class="codetext"></span></li>
                <li><strong><span class="codetext">'example.com/images/*.png'</span> </strong>matches all requests to any subdomain of <span class="codetext">'example.com'</span> that have <span class="codetext">'/images/'</span> as the first segment of the path and <span class="codetext">'.png'</span> as the path extension of an file URL (means it matches all PNG images in the <span class="codetext">'/images/'</span> directory or its subdirectories)<span class="codetext"></span></li>
                <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'*.net'</strong></span> matches all host with any kind of subdomains in the .net top level domain like <span class="codetext">'example.net'</span>, <span class="codetext">'www.example.net'</span>, <span class="codetext">'www.mail.example.net'</span></li>
                <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'*/*.net'</strong></span> matches all files with a <span class="codetext">'.net'</span> file extension on any host<br />
                  <br />
                  You should consider using a regular expression if performing complex filtering (when a simple filter doesn't cover all possible cases how that complex URL could be formatted) or split the expression into several filter rules.  
      
      The order of filter rules is not relevant.<br />

          <p><span class="red">There is also a  command line tool which can be used to reset those values for the unlikely case that the SEB Windows Service didn't work properly or was damaged and can't be run anymore.</span> This tool can be found at the following directory path in your Program Files directory:</p>
          
          <pre>
                <p class="path">SafeExamBrowser\SebWindowsServiceWCF\<span class="red">SebRegistryResetter</span>.exe</p>
          </pre>
          
          <p>You need to execute this tool as administrator (right mouse button context menu &quot;<span class="quote">Run as administrator</span>&quot;). In case the original values for the Registry Settings aren't found anymore, they will be reset to the Windows default values (all enabled). In this latter unlikely case you would also need to enter <strong>the short user name of the user in which account SEB was run</strong>, when the problem occurred. If you were running SEB in your administrator account, the short user name you have to enter usually isn't &quot;Admin&quot; or similar. It is the user name of the account which has the administrator role. The short user name is the same as the <strong>name of the user's home directory</strong> (if you go to C:\Users\ in a Windows Explorer window, you can see all user account names on this computer). If you have spaces in your short user name, enter it as it is, <strong>without quotes</strong>.</p>
