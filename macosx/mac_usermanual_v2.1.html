            Safe Exam Browser 2.1 for macOS
          </h2>
    
          <p>Safe Exam Browser – SEB for macOS opens a web browser window without navigation elements and locks the computer into a kiosk mode, which prevents from switching to other applications or quitting SEB untimely.  <span class="quote">Safe Exam Browser  2.1</span><span class="half_linespace"> enables  secure exams on unmanaged computers like students' own laptops (BYOD) and facilitates the use of SEB in managed environments</span>. Currently SEB integrates with the wide spread learning management systems (LMS) Moodle,  ILIAS and OpenOLAT and several non-commercial and commercial exam systems, as for example Inspera Assessment. Generally it can easily be used with most web-based online quiz and e-assessment systems.<br />

          <p>To prevent switching to other applications or interrupting an exam, SEB disables the macOS Dock, the process switcher (cmd-tab/cmd-shift-tab), the Apple Menu and various other items in the menu bar, the <span class="quote">Force Quit</span> window (cmd-opt-esc), normal reboot (ctrl-cmd-eject), normal shutdown (ctrl-opt-cmd-eject), hiding the application, printing, Exposé, screenshots and the Notification Center. </p>
          <p>Display and system idle sleep is also prevented while SEB is running. It can also be set whether  users can quit SEB and if it is required to enter a quit password to do so.</p>
          <p>Its possible to configure SEB to quit after the exam is submitted without having to enter a quit password by specifying a <span class="quote">quit link</span> and placing this on the summary page displayed by the LMS after submitting the exam.</p>
          <p>In the browser window there is no right mouse (or ctrl-) click popup window available, links requesting to be opened in a separate window can be set to be blocked generally, to open in the same  browser window or in a new SEB window. Besides that, the browser is supporting Java, Quicktime and Flash content (as long as the required  plugins are installed on the system).  SEB 2.1 can also be configured to always use the more secure internal PDF viewer instead of the Acrobat Reader plug-in.</p>
          <p>SEB features an optional dock/task bar displaying an icon for the SEB browser with controls for its open browser windows and widgets. Buttons in the dock for quitting SEB, restarting exam, reloading page and a display for the current time improve usability in exams. Clicking the SEB icon in the dock and holding the left mouse button down or a secondary (right mouse button) click displays a popup menu with all open browser windows, the main browser window is at the bottom. With this menu you can switch between open browser windows.</p>
          <p>It is possible to configure if you want examinees to be able to use the spell and grammar checker and the macOS dictionary lookup feature. Also availability of page and text zoom can be configured.</p>
          <p>SEB detects when it was started in a virtual instead of a native environment and refuses to run. This virtual machine detector hinders manipulating SEB further when used in unmanaged environments.</p>
          <p>SEB 2.1 also detects attempts to switch the user and displays a lock screen afterwards which needs to be unlocked with the quit/restart password by exam supporters/supervisors.</p>
          <p>SEB for macOS is based on the WebKit browser engine, which is also used by Safari, Apple Mail and many open source browsers  (in contrast to the Mozilla Firefox/XULRunner/Gecko engine used by SEB for Windows). There might be some small differences  regarding rendering of web pages in those different browser engines, so you should check all functionality of your quiz in SEB for macOS before using it in exams.  </p>
          <p> SEB for macOS can be used together with additional (third party) applications during an exam. You can download and open files linked in your online exam, edit it in a third party application and then upload the results to your online quiz/LMS again. Currently this is only possible when SEB is used in a separate user account managed by macOS parental controls.</p>
          <p>From version 2.0, encrypted <span class="quote">.seb</span> configuration files are used which allow to individually configure SEB per exam.</p>

          <p><strong><span class="red">Please understand that you also have to configure your exam system correctly to be locked down securely.</span></strong> SEB is generally  locking down exam client computers only, not the exam system or the quiz module of a learning management system. <strong>Check documentation for your exam/learning management system on how to lock it down correctly.</strong></p>

            Using SEB with Supported LMS
          </h3>
          
          <p>Some learning management systems require plugins to be installed to fully support secure exams taken with SEB, others have built-in support.</p>

          <h4 class="seb-section-header sebnavbar-link" id="moodle">
            <a class="anchorjs-link" href="#moodle"></a>
            Using SEB with Moodle</strong>
          </h4>
          
          <p> SEB support in Moodle has the following objectives:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Don't display any links during an exam which would allow to navigate to other sections of Moodle or even other websites. This means the course navigation, link to the user's Moodle profile, logout, link to the University homepage etc. needs to be disabled/hidden. Only the quiz navigation (to navigate to other questions) and the &quot;Finish attempt...&quot; link  should be visible </li>
            <li>Make sure a quiz can only be taken using Safe Exam Browser, display an error message if trying to open the quiz in another web browser. </li>
            <li>Optionally check if the correct version of SEB and  legitimate SEB settings are used.</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>There are two options how to activate SEB support in Moodle. Both achieve the above objectives 1 and 2. Only the second option also ensures objective 3 is met:</p>
          
          <ol>
            <li>Enable the &quot;classic&quot;  SEB support in Moodle: <a href="https://docs.moodle.org/28/en/Safe_exam_browser" target="_blank">How to activate the SEB secure browser mode in a Moodle quiz</a>. Then configure the quiz at <span class="quote">Administration / Quiz administration / Edit settings / Extra restrictions on attempts / Browser security / Require the use of Safe Exam Browser</span>. This option uses only a basic, not very secure check for the used browser. This may be safe enough if students can only access the exam from centrally managed university computers inside a computer lab/exam room. For other scenarios like BYOD you should use the second option.</li>
            <li>Use the <span class="quote"> Browser Exam Key</span> authentication in Moodle for the connecting SEB version and its settings by installing the <a href="https://github.com/moodleou/moodle-quizaccess_safeexambrowser" target="_blank">quiz access rule plugin</a> in Moodle. In addition you will have to copy the Browser Exam Key hash code string into the quiz settings (<span class="quote">Administration / Quiz administration / Edit settings / Extra restrictions on attempts / Allowed browser keys</span>). This key is generated by SEB when you save the settings you intend to use for the exam. As this key includes a hash (checksum) of both the saved exam settings and the code signature of the used SEB version, you may have to generate and copy several Browser Exam Keys into the Moodle quiz settings, for example one for the Windows version of SEB and one for the Mac version.</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>Sometimes hiding course navigation, link to the user's Moodle profile, logout etc. doesn't work as expected because <span class="red">some custom Moodle themes don't support the secure browser mode of Moodle correctly, they display links with which students can get out of the quiz during an exam.</span> If this happens only with your customized theme and not the standard Moodle theme, then your theme is not implemented correctly. In that case you should fix the problem in your custom Moodle theme.  You may also create URL filter rules which only allow to access the exam and no other parts of Moodle, but this is not trivial and we cannot provide you with any support on that. </p>
          <p>You may find additional information and help in the discussion boards for <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/seb/discussion/" target="_blank">SEB</a> and <a href="https://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=737" target="_blank">Moodle</a>.</p>

            <strong>Using SEB with OpenOLAT</strong>
          </h4>
          
          <p>An assessment mode has been added to the OpenOLAT standard with the 10.2 release. The assessment mode allows course authors to limit the functionality and access of OpenOLAT courses for exam settings. An exam setting is not limited to online tests however,  IMS QTI assessments, SCORM modules, external LTI 1.1 tools and all other OpenOLAT course elements can be configured for such an exam setting. </p>
          
          <p>One of the many security features is the enforced usage of  Safe Exam Browser. An exam setting can be configured with multiple <a href="#ExamPane">Browser Exam Key</a> keys.</p>
          
          <p>No additional software needs to be installed in order to use the assessment mode together with  Safe Exam Browser. The assessment mode is globally enabled / disabled in Administration -&gt; Modules -&gt; Assessment mode. Within the courses the configuration is done in the course menu. </p>

            Starting and Quitting SEB
          </h3>
          
          <p>When you start SEB, all currently running applications are hidden and all attached screens are covered with a black background. On the main screen SEB opens its web browser window filling the whole screen (the window can be resized and moved nevertheless). Optionally you can use a full screen presentation or customize the relative or absolute width, height and horizontal positioning of the SEB main browser window and separately for secondary browser windows.</p>
          
          <p>SEB opens the webpage at the preset <span class="quote">Start URL</span>, which might take some seconds. Initially, as long as you don't set another <span class="quote">Start URL</span> (see <a href="#configuration">Configuration</a>), SEB for macOS opens the project web site displaying this documentation.</p>
          
          <p>SEB can display navigation buttons in the browser window toolbar (if enabled), and if browsing back/forward has been enabled, you can use <span class="quote">cmd-Cursor Left</span> to go back in the browser history and <span class="quote">cmd-Cursor Right</span> to go forward in  history. <span class="quote">Cmd-R</span> reloads the current page.</p>
          
          <p>To quit SEB (while it's using the default settings), just press the quit button in the SEB dock, <span class="quote">cmd-Q</span> or the red close button in the browser window. Quitting SEB can (and should in most cases) be  password protected in its settings. When SEB quits, the applications which were visible before starting SEB will get unhidden again.</p>

            Configuration
          </h3>
        
          <p>SEB for macOS has a comfortable  built-in editor for the platform-independent SEB configuration files, which can also set all additional individual settings for the Windows version. Invoke it by selecting <span class="quote">Preferences…</span> in the SafeExamBrowser menu (if visible), by simultaneously pressing the <span class="quote">cmd - ,</span> (comma) keys, or the <span class="quote">F3 and F6</span> keys (on modern Mac keyboards you usually also have to hold the <span class="quote">fn</span> key). After setting a <span class="quote">SEB administrator password</span>, users have to enter this to display the preferences window. SEB for macOS can also be configured not to display the preferences window at all, this could make sense on exam client computers.</p>
          
          <p>While the preferences window is displayed, switching to other running (initially hidden) applications is possible and the screen background isn't blacked out. Also the menu bar is displayed, so  SEB menu commands can be used. You can also drag and drop <span class="quote">.seb</span> configuration files onto the preferences window or the SEB icon in the macOS dock (not the SEB dock). In the preferences window 9 tabs with grouped settings are available. </p>
          
          <ul id="seblist">
            <li>In the <span class="quote">General</span> pane you'll find  basic settings like the URL which SEB opens and the passwords to enter preferences or open a config file for editing and to quit/restart SEB. When first time using SEB, you might only have to change these general settings, as the default values for all other settings should reflect the more &quot;secure&quot; option.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Config File</span> contains details about encryption of the SEB <span class="quote">.seb</span> configuration files plus all functions to deal with opening, saving, reverting, duplicating and applying settings. These commands can also be accessed in the <span class="quote">Settings</span> menu  and the popdown menu in the preferences window title bar (clicking on the triangle symbol). </li>
            <li><span class="quote">User Interface</span> contains general SEB user interface settings; </li>
            <li><span class="quote">Browser</span> all detail settings for the built-in SEB web browser. </li>
            <li><span class="quote">Down/Uploads</span> refers to   file downloads and uploads, <span class="quote">Exam</span> handles the connection to  exam systems and exam specific settings. </li>

            <li><span class="quote">Network</span> about the URL filter, certificates and proxies. </li>
            <li><span class="quote">Security</span> contains detail settings about how SEB locks down security relevant system features.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p class="seb-section-header"><strong>There are two different modes in which you can edit settings: </strong></p>
          
          <ul id="seblist">
            <li><span class="quote">Edit local client settings</span>: Changes settings of this SEB client. These <span class="quote">local client settings</span> are saved persistently on drive (in the ~Library/Preferences/ directory). When you change a setting option, then  it is immediately saved (this is how preferences in other macOS standard applications work). <br />
            <strong>In the title bar of the Preferences window</strong> <em>'Local Client Settings' </em>is displayed instead of a file name.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Edit a .seb settings file</span>:  When you open a settings file, it is always loaded temporary into memory and will be discarded when you quit SEB. So loading a .seb settings file for editing into the Preferences window (which serves as the configuration editor in SEB for macOS, similar to the SEB Config Tool in SEB for Windows) won't change settings of this SEB client permanently. If you change something, you have to explicitly save the changed settings into the same file  (using the command <span class="quote">Save</span>) or to another file (<span class="quote">Save As</span>…). <br />
            <strong>In the title bar of the Preferences window</strong> the file name of the currently loaded settings file<span class="quote"></span> is displayed, together with an file icon. As usual in macOS document windows, you can cmd-click this icon to show the path where the file is saved (as long as it already was saved on drive, see below).    </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p class="seb-section-header">You can switch from <em>editing local client settings</em> to <em>editing a settings file</em> with the commands:</p>
          
          <ul id="seblist">
            <li><span class="quote">Save As…</span> Saves local client settings into a .seb file and  if answering the following dialog 'Edit Saved Settings'? with <span class="quote">Edit File</span> switches from local client settings to the new file.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Edit Duplicate</span>: Switches to editing a settings file (with the default file name <span class="path">SebClientSettings.seb</span>), when saving this config file, the file chooser will be displayed to select a destination directory and to change the file name if desired.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p class="seb-section-header">You can switch from <em>editing a settings file</em> to  <em>local client settings</em> with:</p>
          
          <ul id="seblist">
            <li><span class="quote">Revert Settings to Local Client Settings</span>: The currently edited settings file is discarded and SEB switches back to editing local client settings.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Use Current Settings to Configure Client</span>: Settings from the .seb file which is currently being edited are used to configure local client settings (overwriting current local client settings) and SEB  switches to editing local client settings.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>When closing the Preferences window, SEB asks if edited settings should be saved (if you were editing a .seb settings file, local client settings are autosaved as described above). SEB also asks if those edited settings should be applied. If you answer <span class="quote">Don't Apply</span>, then edited settings are discarded and SEB continues using settings which were in place before opening the Preferences window. If you answer <span class="quote">Apply</span>, then SEB reconfigures and restarts itself using those edited settings, and the web page at <em>Start</em> <em>URL</em> is loaded.</p>
          
          <p>If you apply an opened/edited .seb settings file, then SEB is running in the exam mode, same as if SEB is started opening a .seb config file for starting an exam or if the user loaded a .seb config file for starting an exam from an exam portal page. More information about this you can find in the   <a href="../presentations/HowTo_SEB2.0.pdf" target="_blank">how to use SEB 2.0 document</a> explaining the concept behind SEB 2.x.</p>
          <p>Detail description of all parameters in the preferences window panes follows below.

Starting SEB version 2.0, it isn't anymore possible to deploy the <span class="path">org.safeexambrowser.Safe-Exam-Browser.plist</span> file from the Preferences folder to other machines (due to stronger, individual encryption per client). Instead, either deploy and open a .seb config file saved with the option 'Use SEB settings file for ... configuring a client'. This requires user interaction, because SEB will show an alert <em>'Local settings of this SEB client have been reconfigured. Do you want to continue working with SEB now or quit?'</em> and one of the buttons 'Continue' or 'Quit' has to be clicked. As an alternative, you can use the new pre-configuration feature when deploying SEB on managed systems which works similar like in SEB for Windows (and doesn't require user interaction): </p>
          
          <p>While starting, SEB now checks if there is a configuration file named <span class="path">SebClientSettings.seb</span> in in the Preferences folder (<span class="path">~/Library/Preferences/</span>) and reconfigures itself silently (no user feedback) to the settings in that file, then the file is deleted. This works only if the administrator password in this file matches the one set in the local settings of the SEB client or if there isn't an administrator password set yet in the local settings. This means, if the SEB clients haven't been configured before (because SEB just got installed), you can set an arbitrary administrator password in the  <em>SebClientSettings.seb</em> file. The second time you reconfigure SEB clients with this method, the administrator password in the new <em>SebClientSettings.seb</em> file has to match the one used before, otherwise the client won't be reconfigured. The file can either be unencrypted or encrypted with a password that matches the administrator password set in the local settings of the SEB client (otherwise the password to decrypt the settings file will be prompted and the user has to enter it).</p>
          
          <p>In the rare case you would have a problem with the local client settings of a client computer, for example if SEB crashes after starting, you should try to reset the local client settings. Since OS X 10.9 Mavericks this isn't possible by just deleting the <em>org.safeexambrowser.Safe-Exam-Browser.plist</em> file from the <em>Preferences</em> folder, because macOS caches those preferences. Instead use the command <span class="codetext">defaults delete org.safeexambrowser.Safe-Exam-Browser</span> from the Terminal app shell. Then you should be able to start SEB again, as local settings are  reset to the default values (there will be a message displayed indicating that local client settings were reset when you start SEB).</p>

              Use this option only when running SEB in a user account managed by parental controls, with only SEB and the desired applications allowed.

Depending on the Flash video player and the Mac used, it can be difficult to switch back from full screen mode (best is to use the <span class="quote">esc</span> key), so if you don't need full screen mode, don't enable it here.

They can nevertheless have the option &quot;Autostart&quot; set, in this case SEB attempts to start the permitted process regardless if it was already running or not (and the option &quot;Icon in task bar&quot; is considered in this case). <br />
              <strong> If you need some background process running together with SEB and this process might display some window or alert/message box, you have to add this process's executable to permitted processes with the option &quot;Allow running in background&quot; set, otherwise SEB will hide the window of the background process when &quot;Monitor processes&quot; is selected (or even terminate that process, in case it cannot be hidden).</strong></li>

              Disabling this setting  does not mean that processes are not killed: Depending on the platform's capabilities, SEB first tries to terminate prohibited processes and applications nicely or asking the user to do it themselves, if this doesn't work then it terminates them anyways (as long as <em>monitor processes</em> is enabled). But enabling <em>Force quit</em> will speed up this process.<br />
              This flag should not be set for macOS applications which allow to be terminated nicely (they are anyways automatically terminated, without asking the user).</li>

          <p>Java applications (like OpenOffice) can  be used as permitted processes, but require specific settings: The title of their main window must be defined in  the field <span class="quote">Permitted Processes -&gt; Identifier</span> (for example &quot;OpenOffice Calc&quot;), the required main executable in <span class="quote">Permitted Processes -&gt; Executable</span> (&quot;scalc.exe&quot;) and the process which is actually handling the main window in <span class="quote">Permitted Processes -&gt; Window Handling Process(es)</span> (&quot;soffice.bin&quot;). For this example the executable path should be entered as &quot;program&quot; in <span class="quote">Permitted Processes -&gt; Path</span>, as that is the relative path to the main executable from the OpenOffice main directory, which is registered in Windows <span class="quote">App Paths</span>.</p>

          <p>List of processes which are prohibited to run during an exam  when <span class="quote">monitor processes</span> is enabled. This prohibited list of processes makes sense because SEB  usually allows to run system processes (SEB for macOS allows all processes and applications signed by Apple to run), but some of them might not be wanted during an exam. With prohibited processes you can prevent some specific background processes and applications from running together with SEB. Use this with care, test if the system continues to run safely when the prohibited processes are killed by SEB.</p>

            </li>
            <li> <span class="quote">Filter also embedded content</span>: If selected, also all embedded ressources will be filtered using the filter set.    Note that there can be hundreds of resources such as images and other media per page, so filtering all content may slow down page loading.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The table contains  URL filter rules, consisting of a <span class="quote">allow</span> or <span class="quote">block</span> action. The URL filter always first processes rules with the block action, if one matches, then the according http request is discarded. If no block rule matched, then rules with an allow action are processed. If one matches, then the request is loaded. If no allow rule matched, then the request is discarded.<br />
          Discarding a http request means that a link with the URL is not followed and the user is notified with an alert. When content filtering is enabled, an embedded resource with the according URL is not loaded, in this case there's no notification about that, but it is written to the log (log level Warning on Mac). Create a new rule  by clicking the<span class="codetext">'+'</span> button below the table. Remove a rule by selecting it in the table and clicking the <span class="codetext">'-'</span> button.</p>
          
          <p>SEB automatically creates an allow filter rule for the exact address of the <span class="quote">Start URL</span> defined in these settings. This means that if your <span class="quote">Start URL</span> is <span class="path">example.com</span>, then all pages and resources in the domain example.com  will be allowed. If your <span class="quote">Start URL</span> is <span class="path">example.com/exams/engineering2015-1.html</span>, then only the pages with this exact address will be allowed. In this case you have to manually add an allow filter rule so all pages and resources your exam uses will be allowed (like <span class="path">example.com/exams/*</span>).</p>
          
          <p class="seb-section-header quote">Rules</p>

            <li><span class="quote">Regex</span>:
              Indicates if the  rule is a regular expression. <br />
            If <em>Regex</em> is not checked, then the rule can be formatted using the wildcard <span class="codetext">'*'</span>, which stands for an arbitrary string of any length.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Action</span> to process if the corresponding expression matches. Possible actions:
      <ul id="seblist">
                <li><span class="quote">block</span><br />
                If the URL matches the expression, then it is rejected and processing of the remaining rules  is stopped.</li>

                  If the URL matches the expression, then it is accepted and processing of the remaining rules  is stopped.</li>
              </ul>
              <br />
            If the URL filter reaches  the last rule (means there was no matching block or allow expression found), then the URL is discarded.

              A Text field which contains  the filtering expression or pattern, either in a regular expression (Regex) format or a simpler filter expression containing the wildcard char <span class="codetext">'*'</span>. A filter expression can filter against all elements of a URL/URI according to <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986" target="_blank">RFC 3986</a>: <span class="codetext"><br />

                <li>Scheme  is optional, and must be followed by <span class="codetext">'://'</span>.<br />
                </li>
                <li>The host field is required (besides when filtering against a protocol like about:blank or data:), and is either a partial or full hostname or an IP address. It can also contain or be replaced completely with the wildcard <span class="codetext">'*'</span> char, see below for details. The URL filter doesn't resolve hostnames itself, so if you allow everything and only block <span class="codetext">'hostname.com'</span>, then that host could still be reached using its IP address. You should therefore mainly use whitelisting to allow accessing only specific sites during an exam.</li>
                <li>An optional <span class="codetext">'.'</span> (dot) can prefix the host field to disable subdomain matching, see below for details.</li>
                <li>An optional port can come after the host and always has to start with the character <span class="codetext">':'</span>. It must be a valid port value from 1 to 65535.</li>
                <li>An optional path can come after the host or after the port and always has to start with the character <span class="codetext">'/'</span>. Parts of the path can be replaced with the wildcard char <span class="codetext">'*'</span>.</li>
                <li>URL parameters like a query string can be indicated and always have to start with the character <span class="codetext">'?'</span>. Parts of the query can be replaced with the wildcard char <span class="codetext">'*'</span>.</li>
                <li>Filtering against a fragment usually doesn't make sense, as the content can be reached by scrolling the loaded page. Allowing specific fragments could force people to use a link to a particular anchor on a page (other links would not work).<br />

                <li><strong><span class="codetext">'example.com/images/*.png'</span> </strong>matches all requests to any subdomain of <span class="codetext">'example.com'</span> that have <span class="codetext">'/images/'</span> as the first segment of the path and <span class="codetext">'.png'</span> as the path extension of an file URL (means it matches all PNG images in the <span class="codetext">'/images/'</span> directory or its subdirectories)<span class="codetext"></span></li>
                <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'*.net'</strong></span> matches all host with any kind of subdomains in the .net top level domain like <span class="codetext">'example.net'</span>, <span class="codetext">'www.example.net'</span>, <span class="codetext">'www.mail.example.net'</span></li>

                  You should consider using a regular expression if performing complex filtering (when a simple filter doesn't cover all possible cases how that complex URL could be formatted) or split the expression into several filter rules.

            <li><span class="quote">SEB Service policy</span>: The SEB Service is a background process running with elevated privileges (as administrator/Root), which is necessary to block and unblock some system features (in macOS <span class="quote"> Fast User Switching</span>, disabling the Notification Center  while working with third party applications) and killing prohibited system processes when using <span class="quote">monitor processes</span>.  SEB Service is installed automatically with SEB downloaded from <a href="../download_en.html#MacOSX">safeexambrowser.org</a>, but needs to be installed manually when installing SEB from the App Store. You can define the policy that applies when an exam client doesn't have the SEB Service installed:
          </li>
              <ul id="seblist">
                <li><span class="quote">allow to use SEB without service</span>:  SEB  is allowed to run without the SEB Service, it will only be noted in the log that the service was not securing the computer during the exam.</li>
                <li><span class="quote">warn when service is not running</span>: A warning is displayed when the service is not installed/running, but the exam can be started.</li>
                <li><span class="quote">allow to use SEB only with service</span>:  SEB  is only allowed to run when the SEB Service is installed. <br />
                </li>
            </ul>
                <strong>SEB 2.1 for macOS doesn't  use a SEB Service.</strong> Currently this setting has an effect in SEB for Windows only.<br />&nbsp;
            <li><span class="quote">Allow SEB to run inside virtual machine</span>: Indicates if SEB is allowed to run in a virtual machine (e.g. for exams in virtual desktop environments) or not (in order to prevent potential manipulations).</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Enable screen capture</span>: Controls macOS screen capture (invoked with cmd-3 and cmd-4), corresponds with Enable Print Screen in Windows. If users have the DropBox client installed and activated to upload screen shots directly to their DropBox, then this will also be stopped when screen capture is disabled.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Allow user switching</span>: Indicates if <em>Fast User Switching</em> is allowed. When using SEB on students' own computers this key should be set to false. Otherwise when the computer is put to sleep and woken up again, in the lock screen &quot;Switch user&quot; is shown and when using a third party application or enabling the menu bar the <em>Fast User Switching</em> option is displayed on the right side of the menu bar.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Disable app switcher when starting</span>: SEB checks for the command key being held down while SEB is starting up. This prevents using the application switcher to mess with SEB's kiosk mode</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Force installation in Applications folder</span>: SEB enforces to be installed in an Applications folder (/Applications or ~/Applications)</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Enable logging</span>: The log can help in debugging SEB (if you send it to the developers) and to find out about possible manipulations. You can save the log to a network drive mounted on all exam client computers, since the log's name is unique and contains the machine's name and IP address. </li>
            <li><span class="quote">Log level</span>: The log level indicates which information gets saved. <strong>Error</strong> includes fatal application and browser level errors, <strong>Warning</strong> are non-fatal but non-expected or security affecting events. <strong>Info</strong> includes most user actions including all browser navigation actions like addresses of opened web pages. <strong>Debug</strong> is reserved for information which is only necessary for in-deep program code debugging. The log will contain the selected log level plus all levels with a lower value, a log with the <strong>Verbose</strong> level contains events of all levels.. Default is Warning (error and warning messages).  <strong>Debug</strong> and <strong>Verbose</strong> are meant for debugging (send such a log file to the SEB developers to find out details about a problem). </li>
            <li><span class="quote">Save log file to</span>: Choose the directory where to save the log to. <!--If you select a path inside the current user's home directory, then the path to the home directory is internally replaced with the according tilde placeholder (~/), so this abreviated relative path will also work on a client computer with another home directory name. -->You could also save the log to a network drive mounted on the exam client computer. </li>
            <li><span class="quote">Use standard directory</span>: The log is saved to the directory <span class="path">~/Library/Logs/Safe Exam Browser/</span> which is also displayed in the Console app log list.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Log file directory Windows</span>: Enter a valid,    Windows-specific formatted path.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p class="seb-section-header quote">Settings for SEB Windows</p>
          
          <ul id="seblist">
            <li><span class="quote">System Lockdown</span>: The <span class="quote">Kiosk mode</span>  settings reflect how the computer is locked down while SEB is running, see <a href="win_usermanual_en.html#SecurityPane">Windows manual</a> for details. <span class="quote">Enable WiFi control</span>: Displays a control icon in the SEB task bar allowing to reconnect to Wi-Fi networks used before. In SEB 2.1 for macOS this control doesn't exist yet, you can use <span class="quote">Show menu bar</span> in the <a href="#AppearancePane">Appearance pane</a> instead for a similar functionality.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Registry</span>: Select which options in the Windows Security Screen invoked by Ctrl-Alt-Del should be available while SEB is running (switch user, lock this computer, change a password, start Task Manager, log off, shut down, ease of access). In addition the Registry setting <span class="quote">Enable VMware Client Shade</span> activates the 'Shade' bar at the upper edge of a virtual desktop. If you're not using VMware, this setting doesn't have any effect.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Hooked Keys</span>: Here you can select which special and function keys are blocked or enabled. Note: <span class="quote">Enable Print Screen</span> corresponds with <span class="quote">Enable screen capture</span> in macOS (changing one settings also changes the other). Same as in macOS, if users have the DropBox client installed and activated to upload screen shots directly to their DropBox, then this will also be stopped when Print Screen is disabled.</li>

          </h3>
          
          <p>As mentioned, it is more secure to use SEB for macOS  in a managed environment, for <strong>using third party applications</strong> it's generally recommended in version 2.1.  When you create a separate user account with the settings described below, you can  achieve a really secure environment.</p>
          
          <ul id="seblist">
            <li>Create a <span class="quote">Standard</span> or <span class="quote">Managed with Parental Controls</span> user account (<span class="quote">System Preferences -&gt; Accounts</span>). For running third party applications together with SEB, you have to use an account managed by parental controls.</li>
            <li>You can add SEB to <span class="quote">Login Items</span> in the Account Preferences, then SEB will be started automatically after the exam user logs in.</li>
            <li>In <span class="quote">Login Options</span> you should uncheck the checkbox in front of <span class="quote">Show fast user switching menu as</span>, at least when the examinees have access to other accounts on that computer.</li>
            <li> If you use an account with parental controls and third party applications, you can set (<span class="quote">System Preferences -&gt; Parental Controls</span>) the option <span class="quote">Simple Finder</span> and <span class="quote">Only allow selected applications</span> with only SEB and the desired third party applications selected and in the <span class="quote">Web </span>tab <span class="quote">Allow access to only these websites</span> the URL to your LMS server.</li>
            <li>In <span class="quote">System Preferences -&gt; Sharing</span> you should switch off everything, especially <span class="quote">Screen Sharing</span>, <span class="quote">File Sharing</span>, <span class="quote">Remote Login</span>, <span class="quote">Remote Management</span> and <span class="quote">Internet Sharing</span>. Or protect everything with proper passwords and don't give  users administrator rights on that computer.</li>
            <li> Enable <span class="quote">Open Firmware Password</span>: The Open Firmware password is a security feature available on modern Macintosh systems. If you enable the Open Firmware password, the computer will execute a secure boot sequence. Specifically, enabling the Open Firmware password prevents users from starting up the computer from a volume other than the chosen as the startup disk (chosen in the <span class="quote">Startup Disk</span> preference panel within the <span class="quote">System Preferences</span>.) Also, enabling the Open Firmware Password prevents users from booting into single user mode using Command-S key combination at boot time. An administrator can enable the Open Firmware password booting up from the restore partition (hold Cmd-R while powering computer up) and using the Set Firmware Password menu option. In OS X 10.7 you need to use the <span class="quote">Firmware Password Utility</span> application that can be copied from the macOS software installation disc (located at <span class="path">/Applications/Utilities/</span> on the disc, not visible in Finder, use the Terminal).<br />
              The Open Firmware Password will be reset if a user changes the amount of the physical memory in the machine and reboots. Systems which require Open Firmware Password level security need to be protected from users gaining physical access to the internals of the computer.</li>
