            SafeExamBrowser 2.1.11 for iOS
          </h2>
    
          <p>SafeExamBrowser (SEB) is a secure kiosk web browser environment used to carry out e-assessments that run on exam servers. SEB opens a web browser without an address and search bar, loads a pre-configured webpage and locks an iPad (or iPhone or iPod Touch) into a single app kiosk mode. This mode prevents students from switching to other apps, accessing websites and communicating with other students during an exam. SEB enables secure exams on unmanaged iOS devices like students' own iPads as well as on iOS devices owned and managed by an institution. SEB doesn't use a centralized server or cloud service; it can be configured with an API, config files and config links. It can be used with most web-based quiz and e-assessment systems. For improved security and usability, some exam systems provide additional built-in support for SEB. Currently, SEB integrates especially well with learning management systems (LMS) such as Moodle, ILIAS and OpenOLAT and with several non-commercial and commercial exam systems, such as Inspera Assessment.</p>
          <p><strong>The following manual explains how to configure and use SEB for iOS from the perspective of exam administrators.</strong> SEB is a very flexible and modular tool, therefore documentation for examinees on how to use SEB with individual exam setups and the various exam systems it works with should be provided by the institution using SEB or their e-assessment provider.<br />

            Features
          </h3>
          
          <p>To prevent switching to other apps or interrupting an exam, SEB for iOS uses <a href="#SecurityPane">one of the single app modes</a> provided by the iOS operating system. After  an exam is submitted, SEB  can automatically end the app self-lock (or ASAM) kiosk mode (an exam invigilator could also use a quit password to end the SEB browser session and unlock the device before an exam is finished). </p>
          <p>SEB features an optional Dock displaying an icon for the SEB browser. Tapping this icon or swiping right from the left screen edge reveals a left slider menu with a list of open browser tabs and commands. With these commands in the slider menu and  buttons in the dock you can  (if enabled in settings) quit a browser session, jump back to the start page of an exam, reload the page, navigate back/forward in the browsing history of the exam or  on web pages which are open in additional browser tabs. </p>
          <p>Depending on the single app mode used, auto-correction and predictive text are always or optionally disabled during an exam.  Auto-lock and display  idle sleep is also disabled by default while SEB is running. </p>
          <p>SEB also detects attempts to restart the device during an exam and displays a lock screen if the same exam is opened again. The locked exam can only be continued or attempted again after being unlocked with the quit password by exam supporters/supervisors.</p>
          <p>SEB for iOS uses the same format  for  encrypted <span class="quote">.seb</span> configuration files as the SEB versions for other platforms. Those Config Files   allow to individually configure SEB to display an exam start page or an exam portal page (with a list of current exams). If SEB for iOS is installed using a mobile device management (MDM) system, its initial configuration can easily be deployed using the &quot;MDM Managed Configuration&quot; feature.</p>
          <p>You can also  directly start an exam with an individual configuration in SEB for iOS using a special config hyperlink (using the custom SEB URL protocols/schemes seb/sebs instead of http/https). This link can be opened by examinees from Safari, Mail or some messenger app. When such a link is tapped, usually a dialog is displayed confirming if it should be opened in SEB. Then SEB opens the SEB Config File which is referred by the config link (for example sebs://shoolserver.edu/exams/demoexam.seb) and SEB is using the individual settings from that Config File, which include the actual URL of the exam (contained in the <a href="#GeneralPane">Start URL setting</a>).</p>

            Using SEB with Supported LMS
          </h3>
          
          <p>Some learning management systems require plugins to be installed to fully support secure exams taken with SEB, others have built-in support. <strong><span class="red">Please note that you  have to configure your exam system correctly to be locked down securely.</span></strong> SEB is generally  locking down exam client devices only, not the exam system or the quiz module of a learning management system. <strong>Check documentation for your exam/learning management system on how to lock it down correctly for an exam.</strong></p>

            Using SEB with Moodle</strong>
          </h4>
          
          <p> SEB support in Moodle has the following objectives:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Don't display any links during an exam which would allow to navigate to other sections of Moodle or even other websites. This means the course navigation, link to the user's Moodle profile, logout, link to the University homepage etc. needs to be disabled/hidden. Only the quiz navigation (to navigate to other questions) and the &quot;Finish attempt...&quot; link  should be visible </li>
            <li>Make sure a quiz can only be taken using Safe Exam Browser, display an error message if trying to open the quiz in another web browser. </li>
            <li>Optionally check if the correct version of SEB and  legitimate SEB settings are used.</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>There are two options how to activate SEB support in Moodle. Both achieve the above objectives 1 and 2. Only the second option also ensures objective 3 is met:</p>
          
          <ol>
            <li>Enable the &quot;classic&quot;  SEB support in Moodle: <a href="https://docs.moodle.org/28/en/Safe_exam_browser" target="_blank">How to activate the SEB secure browser mode in a Moodle quiz</a>. Then configure the quiz at <span class="quote">Administration / Quiz administration / Edit settings / Extra restrictions on attempts / Browser security / Require the use of Safe Exam Browser</span>. This option uses only a basic, not very secure check for the used browser. This may be safe enough if students can only access the exam from centrally managed university computers inside a computer lab/exam room. For other scenarios like BYOD you should use the second option.</li>
            <li><span class="red">Not yet supported in SEB for iOS:</span> Use the <span class="quote"> Browser Exam Key</span> authentication in Moodle for the connecting SEB version and its settings by installing the <a href="https://github.com/moodleou/moodle-quizaccess_safeexambrowser" target="_blank">quiz access rule plugin</a> in Moodle. In addition you will have to copy the Browser Exam Key hash code string into the quiz settings (<span class="quote">Administration / Quiz administration / Edit settings / Extra restrictions on attempts / Allowed browser keys</span>). This key is generated by SEB when you save the settings you intend to use for the exam. As this key includes a hash (checksum) of both the saved exam settings and the code signature of the used SEB version, you may have to generate and copy several Browser Exam Keys into the Moodle quiz settings, for example one for the Windows version of SEB and one for the Mac version.</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>Sometimes hiding course navigation, link to the user's Moodle profile, logout etc. doesn't work as expected because <span class="red">some custom Moodle themes don't support the secure browser mode of Moodle correctly, they display links with which students can get out of the quiz during an exam.</span> If this happens only with your customized theme and not the standard Moodle theme, then your theme is not implemented correctly. In that case you should fix the problem in your custom Moodle theme.  You may also create URL filter rules which only allow to access the exam and no other parts of Moodle, but this is not trivial and we cannot provide you with any support on that. </p>

            <strong>Using SEB with OpenOLAT</strong>
          </h4>
          
          <p>An assessment mode has been added to the OpenOLAT standard with the 10.2 release. The assessment mode allows course authors to limit the functionality and access of OpenOLAT courses for exam settings. An exam setting is not limited to online tests however,  IMS QTI assessments, SCORM modules, external LTI 1.1 tools and all other OpenOLAT course elements can be configured for such an exam setting. </p>
          
          <p>One of the many security features is the enforced usage of  Safe Exam Browser. An exam setting can be configured with multiple <a href="#ExamPane">Browser Exam Key</a> keys. <span class="red">Not yet supported in SEB for iOS.</span></p>
          
          <p>No additional software needs to be installed in order to use the assessment mode together with  Safe Exam Browser. The assessment mode is globally enabled / disabled in Administration -&gt; Modules -&gt; Assessment mode. Within the courses the configuration is done in the course menu. </p>

            Configuration
          </h3>
        
          <p>Configuring SEB for iOS works quite similar as in the SEB desktop versions for macOS and Windows. As the .seb Config Files and seb(s):// config links are generally compatible (platform-independent), you can generate configuration files in SEB for macOS or Windows and use it also for the iOS version. However, in the current desktop versions, the setting options specific to the iOS version cannot be configured yet. If you need to change the default values for these iOS SEB setting options, you have to use the built-in settings editor in SEB for iOS. Below you'll find information about how SEB for iOS can be configured generally and a description of all setting options. </p>

          <h4 class="seb-section-header sebnavbar-link" id="InitialConfigurationAssistant">
            <a class="anchorjs-link" href="#InitialConfigurationAssistant"></a>
            Initial Configuration Assistant
          </h4>
        
          <p>When the SEB app is started the first time, then a new Initial Configuration Assistant is displayed (instead of the <a href="http://safeexambrowser.org/start" target="_blank">default start web page</a> which older SEB versions display). </p>
          <p>The reason SEB displays such a configuration assistant when it is started is simple: SEB doesn't use any centralized server or cloud service. You don't need to register or buy licenses (and enter license keys after installing) to use SEB. Instead your examinees </p>
          <ul>
            <li>either directly start an exam in SEB with a special  exam link which can be opened from Safari, Mail or a messenger app;</li>
            <li> you provide them a link which configures the SEB app on their devices to display your exam system start page or an exam portal page (with links to individual exams);</li>
            <li>you use QR codes printed on paper to start exams or for the initial configuration of the SEB app to connect to your exam system/portal page;</li>
            <li>you use the  &quot;Automatic Client Configuration&quot; feature, so your students can easily find the initial configuration for SEB by just entering the general URL of your institution;</li>
            <li>if you install SEB using a mobile device management system (MDM) on devices you provide to students, you can pre-configure the SEB app using the Managed Configuration feature most MDM systems provide.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The current version of the Initial Configuration Assistant shows you four options for starting an exam or configuring SEB for your institution:</p>

          <img class="img-responsive" src="images/SEB_InitialConfigurationAssistant.png" />
 
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Open an SEB exam or configuration link from Safari, Mail or a messenger app: </strong>To try this out, you can switch to Safari (as at this point SEB isn't yet running  in a single app mode) and open the <a href="http://safeexambrowser.org/exams/" target="_blank">demo exam portal page</a> there. If you now click one of the  links on this page, iOS will open the  SEB app (after confirming this in the alert Safari displays) and the Config File referred to by the config link will be opened in SEB. This is one way of starting SEB with an individual exam configuration, by opening an seb(s):// link from Safari/Mail or another app. This method is often being used in the macOS and Windows versions, SEB for iOS is compatible with this.</li>
            <li><strong>Enter a URL of an institution which supports SEB:</strong> This is a new feature, called &quot;Automatic Client Configuration&quot;. An institution can place an SEB Config File at a specific path on their web server. SEB will search those predefined paths (there are three variations possible) when the main URL of that institution is typed in. You can try to enter <span class="quote">safeexambrowser.github.io</span>, SEB will then be reconfigured to display the demo exam portal page mentioned above (this is for demonstration, usually you would set up Automatic Client Configuration to work with the top-level URL of your institution, so for example with &quot;myuniversity.edu&quot;).</li>
            <li><strong>Scan SEB configuration QR code:</strong> If you generate a QR code which contains an seb(s):// URL to an SEB Config File, then examinees can use the camera in their iOS device to scan the QR code and start exams (or configure the SEB app to show an exam portal page). You could for example print such a QR code onto some instruction sheet for the exam.</li>
            <li><strong>Administrators: Set up your exam:</strong> Tapping the <span class="quote">Edit Settings</span> button opens the built-in SEB settings user interface. There you can configure the SEB app and share those settings in an SEB configuration file. </li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="seb-section-header sebnavbar-link" id="UsingInAppSettings">
            <a class="anchorjs-link" href="#UsingInAppSettings"></a>
            Using In-App Settings
          </h4>
        
          <p>When you start SEB the first time, you can use the <span class="quote">Edit Settings</span> button in the Initial Configuration Assistant. If you already changed the configuration of SEB and it doesn't display the Initial Configuration Assistant anymore, you can  go to the Settings app, find SEB's setting options and enable either the <span class="quote">Allow Editing</span> or <span class="quote">Initiate Settings Reset</span> options. After returning to SEB, you'll have to enter the SEB Admin Password to edit settings or for settings being reset to its default values (then the Initial Configuration Assistant will be displayed again). If you forgot the SEB Admin Password, then you need to delete the SEB app  and re-install it.  </p>
          <p>In the demo settings mentioned above the SEB Admin Password is &quot;seb&quot;. You can also change client settings of SEB for iOS by reconfiguring it with the link <a href="seb://safeexambrowser.org/exams/ClientConfigTesting.seb">Configure Client for Administrators / SEB Testing</a>  on the <a href="http://safeexambrowser.org/exams/" target="_blank">demo portal page,</a> then in the left slider menu (tap SEB logo in the SEB dock at the bottom of the screen or swipe right from left display edge) you will find a command <span class="quote">Edit Settings</span>. The SEB Admin Password used in the demo settings is &quot;seb&quot;, the Quit Password &quot;quit&quot;.</p>
          <p>SEB is generally  customizable to a large extend, to allow  various  use cases and to be compatible to basically every web based examination system. But for the beginning, you often would only need to set the three options in the root settings pane (Start URL, Admin Password, Quit Password).  </p>
          <p>When closing in-app settings with the <span class="quote">Done</span> button,  then SEB reconfigures and restarts itself using those edited settings, and the web page  with the URL set in the <span class="quote">Start URL</span>  field (see below) is loaded.          </p>

          <img class="img-responsive" src="images/SEB_SettingsGeneral.png" />
          
          <ul id="seblist">
            <li><span class="quote">Start URL</span>: Full URL (starting with http:// or https://) of the page to open when SEB is started.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Admin Password</span>: Password required to edit or reset settings. Also if trying to reconfigure SEB with a link &quot;for configuring a client&quot;, if the Admin Passwords in current and new settings don't match, the current Admin Password needs to be entered. It's recommended to always set an SEB administrator password.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Quit Password</span>: This password is prompted when users try to quit an exam session using the Quit button in the SEB Dock (rightmost button), the <span class="quote">Quit Session</span> command in the left slider menu or the  &quot;X&quot; close button in front of the exam tab on top of the left slider menu. If no Quit Password is set, then SEB just prompts "Are you sure you want to quit this session?"<br>
            <strong>The Quit Password setting is also the &quot;switch&quot; for running SEB in a secure mode, using one of the single app (kiosk) modes which iOS provides.</strong> So if you configure SEB for an exam (exam settings), you should always set a Quit Password (as long as it isn't some kind of open book exam which doesn't require that examinees are locked into SEB during the exam). <br>
            <strong>Students usually wouldn't need to manualy quit SEB</strong>, because you should configure and use the <a href="#ExamPane">Quit Link</a> feature to end the exam session and the self-lock single app mode automatically (Quit Link doesn't require to enter the quit password) after the exam is submitted.<br>
            If you configure SEB (client settings) to display an exam portal page, you don't have to set a Quit Password. You would then use links to secure exam settings (with a Quit Password set).</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Share Button</span> (button top left in the navigation bar): This button displays an iOS share sheet, where you can select how to share current  settings as an SEB configuration file (using options set in the <a href="#ConfigFilePane">Config File section</a>). Ideally use a secure channel like AirDrop or iMessage to transfer the Config File to a desktop system where you would upload the Config File to a web server, for using it as an seb(s):// config link. You could also use  an  app like <a href="https://panic.com/transmit-ios/" target="_blank">Transmit</a> which provides a sharing extension to transfer files directly to web servers using SFTP and other protocols.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Done</span>: Close in-app settings, reconfigure and restart SEB using  these edited settings.          </li>

              Config files for configuring clients are
            always encrypted, even if you don't enter a settings password in the field described below. You can also encrypt such Config Files with the same password which is set as administrator password on the SEB client (if there is already one set). If there is no administrator password set on the SEB client yet or you use another settings password, then users are prompted to enter it.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Use Config File for ...

              Disabling this setting  does not mean that processes are not killed: Depending on the platform's capabilities, SEB first tries to terminate prohibited processes and applications nicely or asking the user to do it themselves, if this doesn't work then it terminates them anyways (as long as <em>monitor processes</em> is enabled).

          Discarding a http request means that a link with the URL is not followed and the user is notified with an alert.

            If the URL filter reaches  the last rule (means there was no matching block or allow expression found), then the URL is discarded. If you want the URL to be accepted if no matching block (or allow) expression was found, then add an <span class="codetext">'allow *'</span> expression.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Expression</span>:
              A Text field which contains  the filtering expression or pattern, either in a regular expression (Regex) format or a simpler filter expression containing the wildcard char <span class="codetext">'*'</span>. A filter expression can filter against all elements of a URL/URI according to <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986" target="_blank">RFC 3986</a>: <span class="codetext"><br />
              <br />
              scheme://user:password@host:port/path?query#fragment<br />
              <br />
              </span>      <span class="quote">Format for a filter expression in the non-regex format:</span><br />
              <ul id="seblist">
                <li>Scheme  is optional, and must be followed by <span class="codetext">'://'</span>.<br />
                </li>
                <li>The host field is required (besides when filtering against a protocol like about:blank or data:), and is either a partial or full hostname or an IP address. It can also contain or be replaced completely with the wildcard <span class="codetext">'*'</span> char, see below for details. The URL filter doesn't resolve hostnames itself, so if you allow everything and only block <span class="codetext">'hostname.com'</span>, then that host could still be reached using its IP address. You should therefore mainly use whitelisting to allow accessing only specific sites during an exam.</li>
                <li>An optional <span class="codetext">'.'</span> (dot) can prefix the host field to disable subdomain matching, see below for details.</li>
                <li>An optional port can come after the host and always has to start with the character <span class="codetext">':'</span>. It must be a valid port value from 1 to 65535.</li>
                <li>An optional path can come after the host or after the port and always has to start with the character <span class="codetext">'/'</span>. Parts of the path can be replaced with the wildcard char <span class="codetext">'*'</span>. If a path ends with a <span class="codetext">'/'</span>, that trailing <span class="codetext">'/'</span> is removed (as the filter doesn't distinguish paths with or without trailing <span class="codetext">'/'</span>).</li>
                <li>URL parameters like a query string can be indicated and always have to start with the character <span class="codetext">'?'</span>. Parts of the query can be replaced with the wildcard char <span class="codetext">'*'</span>.</li>
                <li>Filtering against a fragment usually doesn't make sense, as the content can be reached by scrolling the loaded page. Allowing specific fragments could force people to use a link to a particular anchor on a page (other links would not work).<br />
                  <br />
                  <span class="quote">      Examples for filter expressions:</span></li>
                <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'example.com'</strong></span> matches <span class="codetext">'example.com'</span>, <span class="codetext">'www.example.com'</span> and <span class="codetext">'www.mail.example.com'</span> (internally processed as a host name search for <span class="codetext">'example.com'</span> and a search for <span class="codetext">'*.example.com'</span>)</li>
                <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'.www.example.com'</strong></span> matches exactly <span class="codetext">'*://www.example.com'</span>  (no other subdomains)</li>
                <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'mail.*'</strong></span> matches all hosts having a subdomain or domain <span class="codetext">'mail'</span>, like  <span class="codetext">'mail.ethz.ch'</span>, <span class="codetext">'www.mail.gov.to'</span>, <span class="codetext">'mail.com'</span></li>
                <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'*:8088'</strong></span> matches all requests to port 8088</li>
                <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'example.com/stuff/*'</strong></span> matches all requests to any subdomain of <span class="codetext">'example.com'</span> that have <span class="codetext">'stuff'</span> as the first segment of the path<span class="codetext"></span></li>
                <li><strong><span class="codetext">'example.com/images/*.png'</span> </strong>matches all requests to any subdomain of <span class="codetext">'example.com'</span> that have <span class="codetext">'/images/'</span> as the first segment of the path and <span class="codetext">'.png'</span> as the path extension of an file URL (means it matches all PNG images in the <span class="codetext">'/images/'</span> directory or its subdirectories)<span class="codetext"></span></li>
                <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'*.net'</strong></span> matches all host with any kind of subdomains in the .net top level domain like <span class="codetext">'example.net'</span>, <span class="codetext">'www.example.net'</span>, <span class="codetext">'www.mail.example.net'</span></li>
                <li><span class="codetext"><strong>'*/*.net'</strong></span> matches all files with a <span class="codetext">'.net'</span> file extension on any host<br />
                  <br />
                  You should consider using a regular expression if performing complex filtering (when a simple filter doesn't cover all possible cases how that complex URL could be formatted) or split the expression into several filter rules.  
      
      The order of filter rules is not relevant.<br />

            <li><span class="quote">Pin embedded certificates:</span> If this option is selected, the  certficate store of macOS isn't used to evaluate the validity of a server certificate when SEB connects to a secure server using https. You have to embed TLS or CA certificates into SEB settings which establish trust for the secure servers you want SEB to connect to. The used certificates must be valid (not expired, containing the server's host address in &quot;common name&quot; or &quot;alternative names&quot;). If you want to use a certificate which fails validation (for the mentioned reasons), use a &quot;Debug Certificate&quot; which you can add in the &quot;Advanced&quot; window, where you can override &quot;common name&quot; and &quot;alternative names&quot; by changing the displayed name of the certificate into the server's host address (you can also specify a non-default port number).<br>

          <p>SEB support the following iOS single app (kiosk/lock down) modes: </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Automatic Assessment Configuration (AAC)</strong>: Named &quot;app self-lock&quot; in the alert presented to the user. This single app mode can be invoked by assessment apps like SEB even when using unmanaged devices owned by students (for bring-your-own-device BYOD scenarios). The examinee needs to confirm starting AAC in an alert. This is the recommended kiosk mode, as it automatically applies all  required restrictions (for example restricting keyboard and dictionary functions).</li>
            <li> <strong>Autonomous Single App Mode (ASAM)</strong>: Requires device to be supervised (device needs to be specially set-up usually using the macOS application <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-configurator-2/id1037126344?mt=12" target="_blank">Apple Configurator</a>). In addition SEB needs to be set as allowed app to invoke ASAM using a mobile device management system MDM). Then ASAM is automatically invoked (without an alert) when an exam (secure session) is started. <strong>Note that you have to apply additional restrictions manually</strong>, see this <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204775" target="_blank">Apple support document</a>. We therefore recommend to always use AAC if you're not 100% sure about how to deal with these necessary restrictions.</li>
            <li><strong>Classic Single App Mode (SAM)</strong>: The 'classic' Single App Mode can be invoked and again deactivated by Apple's <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/classroom/id1085319084?mt=8" target="_blank">Classroom</a> App, an MDM system or Apple Configurator. <strong>Note that you have to apply additional restrictions manually</strong>, see this <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204775" target="_blank">Apple support document</a>. We therefore recommend to always use AAC if you're not 100% sure about how to deal with these necessary restrictions.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These kiosk/lock down modes are provided by iOS, SEB for iOS doesn't need use  any kind of modifications in the iOS operating system (which  iOS anyways doesn't allow). </p>
          <p>SEB needs to be configured  and exams started differently depending on the single app mode used. If you don't have experience with supervised devices or MDM systems, you probably should just use the AAC app self-lock mode which works on all devices.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="quote">Use AAC/ASAM If Available</span>: Either AAC (for BYOD) is used or ASAM on a supervised device, where SEB is set as allowed app to invoke ASAM.  We recommend to always use AAC, which provides several important additional restrictions.  If ASAM is available on a device,  AAC won't be invoked.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Allow Single App Mode (SAM)</span>: When this option is enabled for exam settings, then after starting an exam (which has a Quit Password set/is running in secure mode) SEB will wait for SAM to be activated by Apple's <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/classroom/id1085319084?mt=8" target="_blank">Classroom</a> App or an MDM system. You can also lock those devices first into SEB. <strong>Please note:</strong> You have to distribute devices already locked into SAM or disable the single app lock mode <span class="quote">Guided Access</span> (which can be activated manually by users) if you want to make sure that only SAM is used by the system. iOS doesn't provide any way to detect if SAM or Guided Access is active on a device.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Download/Open SEB Config Files</span>: Disable for preventing seb(s):// links to be used for starting exams or reconfiguring the client.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Allow QR Code Config</span>: Allows to start an exam or to reconfigure SEB by scanning a QR code with a link to an SEB Config File. This is only possible while SEB isn't running in exam mode. Use slider menu, dock button (if enabled in the  <a href="#DockAndSlider">User Interface Dock sub-pane</a>) or 3D touch Home screen quick action (on a device which supports 3D Touch).</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Prevent Auto-Lock</span>: The device isn't locked and the display  isn't dimmed after the delay set in the Settings App.</li>
            <li><span class="quote">Allow Running on iOS Beta</span>: If you want to test SEB on the beta version of an iOS major release, then you need to explicitly allow this beta version (default value  is &quot;None&quot;). The reason for this setting is, that an iOS beta version might not guarantee full security of the kiosk mode (as it is the case with the first iOS 11 beta release). Also SEB might not yet be adapted to changes in the next iOS major release. With the option &quot;None&quot;, SEB will still run on the final release of for example iOS 11, when we release an adapted SEB version before the public release of iOS 11. With the option &quot;iOS 11&quot;, even if you don't change that setting later, SEB won't run on the beta version of the subsequent major iOS release. You would need to again allow that iOS beta explicitly in settings.</li>
